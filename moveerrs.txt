The mountain's too steep to climb there.
You walk slap into a cliff. Ouch.
The river is much too fast and deep to be crossed here.
The hillside rises too steeply for you to be able to climb it.
A disembodied voice warns "Bathing or boating strictly forbidden!"
There's an extremely nasty drop that way...
The city walls block your way.
Come back when you've taken some flying lessons...
If you go that way you'll be frazzled to a crisp!
You seem to have walked into a wall. Probably not a good idea.
Don't be silly, the gap's much too small for you to fit through!
Er... you'll drown if you go that way, the water will be over your head!
The buildings are locked, bolted, barred and barricaded. No chance.
Are you sure you wouldn't rather live to a ripe old age?
Look... those railings may be rusty, but not that rusty, ok?
What? And spoil the flowers? No... stick to the path.
There's a hedge in the way, but you can TRY to walk through it if you like.
