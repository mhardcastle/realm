This is Realm v3.7c, running under Linux on rosie.sel.cam.ac.uk port 2000.
The game is currently running on an experimental basis only. Queries should
be addressed to mjh22@mrao.cam.ac.uk._

Players have probably noticed that none of the old personae still work on
the game. This is not deliberate and as far as I know it is not a problem
with the game: I believe it to be caused by problems on the host machine.
The bad news is that I don't have a backup. If people can tell me the
names, passwords and approximate scores of their old characters I can
recreate them approximately as they were. Email me for more info. Sorry,
folks._
