This is the online help system of Realm. It's possible to find out
about almost every major aspect of the game by using the HELP command - 
which we're adding to constantly - though details may be a bit sketchy in
places! It's very simple to use - you just type HELP, followed by a slash
('/' or '\') and the first letter of the option you want. For example,
HELP /K will tell you about the fight system. HELP /B might be a good
option to choose if you're a newcomer to the Realm. To find out the range
of low level (system) commands available, type /H._
@
Beginners' Introduction
Realm is very similar to single-user "adventure" games - most computer
junkies have played one sometime - and to role-playing games like Dungeons
and Dragons. You have to wander about the land, collecting treasure, 
slaying monsters, solving puzzles and so forth, to accumulate points and
become an Immortal, a being of ultimate power, rising through 12 different
levels of experience and strength en route. You mainly gain points by 
dropping treasure in the lake (at the top of the mountain, in the centre
of the land) though fighting with 'mobiles' and other players will boost
your score (if you win!) The difference between Realm and single-user games
is, of course, the other players, and you'll probably find these the most
useful resource if you're stuck. Although you compete with them for
treasure and rank, they'll probably give a low-level person a hand. To
find out who else is playing, type WHO. To send a message to all players,
type SHOUT "message". As you've probably gathered, communication with the
computer is by entering simple English commands - N to move north, GET T to
pick up all the treasure in your location, and so on. Experiment! At this
stage it won't matter if you get killed. For a concise list of commands
you can use, type HELP /U._

are ALL, (T)REASURE, (MOB)ILE, KEY, ORC, (KOB)OLD, ARMOUR, GEM, BOW, COIN,
WEAPON, FOOD, FRUIT, TORCH, BIRD, FOSSIL, CONTAINER and SHELL. They represent
all of that type of object that the command could work on (eg GET T, KILL ORC)._

@
Killing things!
This section provides details on how to fight a player or mobile
(in order to gain points or to defend yourself if attacked). Fights are
initialised by typing KILL <mob> (this command also allows you to choose
which mobile to fight if several attack you), and terminated if necessary by
FLEE <dir> (which will lose the fleeing persona a certain amount of points.
Weapons may be used, if owned - to be able to use a weapon use (SEL)ECT
<weapon>. As you have two hands you may also use (SEL)ECT 2 <weapon>
which puts a weapon in your left hand. (SEL)ECT on its own gives details
of the weapons you are using. Weapons increase your power in a fight._
    Once you are armed and fighting (you can fight without a weapon), you
may use the fight commands to attack. The commands available are (SL)ash, 
(ST)rike, (LU)nge and (P)arry; if you are unarmed you may only use (ST)RIKE.
(Don't try to use HIT <mobile> - this command only works outside fights).
The fight commands are coupled with parts of the body; (H)ead,(C)hest,
(M)iddle and (LE)gs. So SL H (SLASH HEAD) would aim a cut at your 
opponent's head; PA LE (PARRY LEGS) would attempt to parry a blow at your
own legs. Including a "2" in the fight commands allows you to use your 
secondary (left-hand) weapon (eg LU 2 CH, lunge with left hand at chest).
Rangers may use STRIKE 3 to combat kick (eg ST 3 H, kick to head).
You may also use THROW <weapon> at this point, eg THROW KNIFE (this
command works out of fights as well, used as e.g. THROW KNIFE AT ORC)._
    When the blow has been initialised it takes a little while to take
effect, based on your dexterity and the weight of your weapon. During this
time your opponent may try to parry, or, of course, start a blow of his/her
own. You may feint by initialising two blows in quick succession. When a blow
does take effect the recipient will lose a certain amount of stamina
(unless he/she's an Immortal!) If this drops below zero he/she will die;
his/her opponent will gain points while he/she will lose them. In certain
circumstances you can leave a fight without either losing or gaining points
but normally you escape with FLEE <dir> which knocks a bit off your score._
    A normal fight involves only two people, but you may wish to team up to
fight particularly tough mobiles. If e.g. you both do KILL BALROG then you
will both be able to get blows in on him: he will only be able to hit one
of you. Under such circumstances you share the points for killing him._
    A typical combat might look something like this...._
You are in the Room of Roots. To the west is the exit._
A dangerous-looking sabre lies here._
Bedivere is here. Bedivere has the knife._
>GET SABRE_
Sabre taken._
>SEL SABRE_
You are armed with the sabre._
>KILL BED_
You are now fighting Bedivere._
Leaping forward Bedivere aims a vicious cut at your head with the knife._
>PA H_
Your parry succeeds!_
>SL H_
Bedivere directs a feeble slash at your chest with the knife._
Bedivere is sent sprawling by your well-aimed slash at his head with the
sabre._
You are unscathed by Bedivere's clumsy cut at your ribs with the knife._
( Stamina = 160/165 )_
Bedivere has just fled!_
The fight ceases..._
Score: 23453._
The knife falls to the ground._
Bedivere walks out, westwards._
Finally, note that killing players much weaker than yourself is
considered "bad form" and may attract reprisals from Immortals or their
killer personae. All kills of one player by another are logged. Low level
players may use the command INVOKE in a fight to ask Immortals for help._

Spells available to all magic users
This section gives details of the spell casting facilities available
to all Mortal magic users (Immortals have many more spells available 
for the control of their environment). If you are not a magic user (priest
or wizard class) you cannot cast any spells (except with the help of
certain game objects which you'll have to discover for yourself!) Warriors
have the potential to become magic users, if the Wizards' and Priests' Guilds
deem them worthy : to prove yourself worthy, you must perform one or more
heroic deeds. Talk to an Immortal for information. In the spells listing
given below, the numbers after the spell's name are used to indicate (1)
its difficulty (the lower the number, the harder the spell is to cast,
though as you rise in level you'll find spells become easier) and (2) the
drain such a spell puts on your magic stamina. (If the number is followed
by a plus sign "+" this is the MINIMUM cost and the spell could cost more).
Magic stamina can be restored by sleeping (and in one or two other ways
which again are up to you to dicover) but beware - if your magic stamina
falls below zero, you lose your magical powers! The third number after the
spell name, if present, indicates the lowest level you can be before you
can cast the spell. Note also that if a spell is cast ON a player/mobile
(eg SUMMON, BLIND) he/she may be able to resist the spell - in which case it
MAY act on you instead, or send you to sleep. The resistance is determined
by power/level of the caster balanced against power/level of the victim.
Immortals will resist Mortals' spells. Remember also that if you're dumb
you won't be able to say the words of some spells..._
------------------------------------------------------------------------_
_BLIND <mobile>_75      10
Strikes the specified mobile/player blind._
_CRIPPLE <mobile>_75      10
Stops the mobile/player from being able to move._
_DEAF <mobile>_78       7
Makes the mobile/player unable to hear._
_DISENCHANT (<mobile>)_56/8   14/12  2/1
Removes all spells cast on the specified mobile or player - that is
all spells which have a lasting effect, such as GLOW, CRIPPLE, BLIND,
INVISIBLE, SHIELD - which could be cast by the caster of the DISENCHANT
spell (priests can't remove INVISIBLE, for example. Like most of these
spells it can be cast at a distance. If no player/mobile is given it
works on the caster. The left set of numbers is for casting the spell
on someone else, the right hand set for casting on yourself._
_DISPOSSESS <mobile>_73      40    3
Stops somebody possessing the specified mobile. See POSSESS._
_DUMB <mobile>_79       7
Strikes the mobile/player dumb - useful for annoying chatterers. Can also
stop people from using certain spells which involve speech._
_GLOW (<mobile>)_610      12
Causes the mobile/player in question to glow, allowing him/her to see
in the dark. If no name is given, works on the caster._
_POSSESS <mobile>_71      60    5
A very powerful spell allowing complete takeover of a player or mobile.
Once this spell has been cast your commands will act on the mobile as
though they were his/her own (with certain restrictions) until QUIT is
typed or the spell wears off. You will still see things that are
happening in your location but you are obviously in a vulnerable
position while using this spell, so take care._
_PREFIX <player> "<text>"_72       2
Gives the player specified the specified prefix. So PREFIX BEDIVERE
"chivalrous" would give make Bedivere's full name "Bedivere the
chivalrous Enchanter."_
_PRISON <mobile>_71      50     5
Sends the person on whom the spell is cast to the Wizards' Dungeon,
whence it is extremely difficult to escape (and you lose points if you
QUIT from it)._
_SCORE | QS <mobile>_78       5
Gives the specified mobile/player's score details._
_SLEEP <mobile>_612      15     2
Sends the named player or mobile to sleep (though it may rebound on you!)_
_TELL <mobile> "message"_625       1
Gives the specified player/mobile the message, telepathically. ('Ryke's
voice says in your mind "hello there!"' is the sort of message you'd get)._
_WHERE <object>_618       2
Tells you the location of an object. Alternatively_
_WHERE <location>_75      15
Tells you the location of a location, in general terms (e.g. WHERE
"CLEARING" tells you "in the central part of the Realm.")_
@
Wizards' abilities
This is a list of all the spells available to wizards only - mostly
spells to manipulate objects and for offensive purposes. A wizard, while
weaker in combat than a priest, has a greater range of spells. For an
explanation of the numbers used read the HELP /S message._
------------------------------------------------------------------------_
_CALL <object>_76      10+    2
Allows you to summon up any inanimate game object that is not in
certain special locations. Beware, though, for the cost in magic
strength is related to the value of an object, and some objects (e.g. 
the diamond) are so valuable that no mortal can CALL them without
exhausting his/her magical powers. And typing CALL ALL is not a good idea
either!!_
_CHANGE <mobile>_73       5     3
Changes the mobile in question's sex, male to female or vice versa._
_EXPLODE <mobile>_72      40     4
Causes the specified mobile to explode, removing them from the game
without losing them any points (even if used in a fight)._
_ILLUSION <mobile> "message"_72       4
Gives the specified player (or mobile!) the message as if it came
directly from the game. So ILLUS BEDIVERE "You are attacked by an
eleven-foot king Cobra!" would give Bedivere the impression that he
was writhing in the coils of the loathsome reptile._
_INVISIBLE (<mobile>)_73       40     4
Makes the specified player/mobile, or the caster if no name is given,
invisible - obviously conferring some advantage in fights, stealing etc._
_LB <mobile>_78       25
Throws a bolt of lightning at a mobile. Similar to ZAP (see below)
this is more powerful, more costly, and more difficult to cast._
_MOVE <object> <location>_75       20+    3
Changes the location of the object in question to the specified place
(locations are specified as in ZIP, below). The spell costs according
to the value of the object (or, if a mobile, according to its level) so
the same warning applies as given in CALL, earlier._
_NOWALL_74       28     3
Removes all magic walls (WOF or WOS) in your location._
_PUSH <mobile> <direction>_77       20
Forces the specified player/mobile to move in the given direction (but
not in a direction they couldn't normally move). Eg PUSH ORC1 NORTH._
_SHATTER <object>_74       15+    2
Destroys objects. They have to be in your current location and
destroying weapons or treasures can cost you more points - don't try
to shatter the diamond or Excalibur, for example!_
_SUMMON <mobile>_77       20+    3
This spell allows you to call any creature or player to your location.
The cost of this spell is related to the level or power of the player
or mobile you summon, and the spell may be resisted._
_VORPAL <weapon>_72       20     3
For use on edged weapons only. It makes them more powerful._
_WEIGH <object> <value>_71       30     7
Changes an object's weight. <value> is a new weight, in Realm units._
_WOF <direction>_72       60     4
Creates a wall of fire in the given direction. _
_WOS <direction>_72       60     4
Creates a wall of stone in the given direction. WOS N would block off
the north exit to a room, for example._
_ZAP or BLAST <mobile>_610       15
Throws a bolt of fire at a mobile/player, knocking points off his/her
stamina according to caster's level. This can be effective if used in
combat. (If you kill someone with ZAP outside a fight you score a few
points, as is the situation with HIT, BURN, etc)._
_ZIP <location>_76       30      2
Transports you about the Realm. With the command must be given either
an object name, in which case the spell will take you to the object, or
a room name (eg "clearing", "stilton gorge") where the spell will take
you to this location. (Or a location number, but this is of little use
unless you have a VERY good map...) Note that mortals cannot zip to some
of the more important locations in the Land._
@
Priests' abilities
Priests are thought of as a class who, in return for dedicating themselves
to their God, and making certain sacrifices - for example, they may not
use edged weapons - have been endowed with certain magical powers, mostly
concerned with the spiritual rather than the bodily world and with defence
rather than attack (though there are some exceptions). Priests only have
a few spells that are specific to them at the moment, but this list will
increase. For an explanation of the numbers used, read HELP /S._
------------------------------------------------------------------------_
_BLESS <mobile>_71       70       9
Makes the person on whom the spell is cast immune to mobile attack.
It also lifts the action of the CURSE spell._
_CONJURE_72       80       2
Summons up a supernatural being of some kind, whose power depends on your
level. You can command him/her as if he had been SUBDUEd (see below). He/she
may turn on you, if you are weak, to gain his freedom._
_CURSE <mobile>_71       30       3
Makes victim extremely vulnerable to mobile attack (they attack on
sight, in fact...). Both BLESS and CURSE, if cast by high-level priests
or Immortals, may be permanent in effect._
_EXORCISE <mobile>_74       40       4
Return the mobile in question, if a demon or undead type, to the spirit
world. If the spell fails, the mobile will resent it and the caster
will probably fall asleep for some time._
_HEAL (<mobile>) <number>_76        0+
Adds <number> points to someone's stamina while deducting twice that
number from the caster's magic stamina. If used without a name (eg
HEAL 20) this spell works on the caster._
_MBOLT <mobile>_76       15
Blasts the specified mobile with mental energy. Similar to ZAP._
_MOPEN_610       15       3
An unusual spell for a priest in that it deals with the
physical world. It will open most doors in the location._
PRAY "message"_
_    A special command - not a true spell - which enables priests to call
on the Gods for assistance. Any God currently around will be under
obligation to come to your aid. Those who misuse the command,
though, will find the wrath of the Gods hard to survive!_
_SAP <mobile>_610       20       2
Saps the strength of the named mobile by an amount depending on the caster's
level. This can cause the mobile to fall asleep, drop heavy objects, etc._
_SHIELD (<mobile>)_74       50       3
Creates a magical shield round the named mobile (or the caster) which
protects him/her/it from lower level spells and - to some extent - 
from injury by weapon. It wears off after some time._
_SUBDUE <mobile>_73       60       5
Forces the named mobile to obedience to your will. It will then obey
any commands spoken directly to it (eg ORC "GIVE ME SWORD" will order
the orc to hand over the sword) though it may seek to escape your
control. The spell will not work on mobiles that would not understand
speech and some intelligent ones will automatically resist it._
_VIEW <location>_74       10
Allows you to see a location as if you were in it. <location> is either
an object name (VIEW TROLL shows you the room the troll's in at the
moment) or a location name in quotes (VIEW "Watchtower" shows you what
the watchtower looks like)._
@
Immortals' Spells
As well as being able to cast mortal spells, Immortals have the following
goodies available to them..._
------------------------------------------------------------------------_
_ARENA <mob1> <mob2> <points> puts 2 mobiles or players in the arena and
gives the winner <points> points if they fight._
_BAN <player> <days> throws a player off for <days> days._
_BLOT <player> removes a player from the game and wipes their persona
completely. Only to be used in VERY extreme circumstances - this is
logged to disc so any unfairness can be investigated. Only for Gods._
_BYE <player> throws the specified player off the game and off the system
(though they can then come back). A sort of intermediate between
EXPLODE and BLOT._
_CHANGE <obj> </opt> <value> is a complex spell which allows most of the
object parameters and a few of the mobile attributes of <obj> to be
changed. <value> is always an integer - mostly it has to be from 0 to
500, but values between 0 and 255 are traditionally used (from when
Realm ran on a BBC Micro!) </opt> is a letter preceded by a backslash
'\' or a frontslash '/'; for mobiles it can be /s (strength) /d
(dexterity) /c (stamina) /m (magic stamina/concentration) /r
(race) or /t (type - 1 = warrior, 2 = ranger, 3 = wizard, 4 = priest).
Capitals allow you to change maximum values, eg /S - max strength.
Using /+ or /- followed by a number allows you to increase or decrease
the mobile's score. For objects <opt> is /s (slash) /h (hit) /l (lunge)
/p (parry) /a (armour) /t (damage done by throwing) /b (size), /z
(maximum size of objects contained) or /c (liquid contained, currently
0 to 7). E.g. to change the troll's dexterity to 255, do CHANGE TROLL
/D 255. To render the buckler useless, CHANGE BUCKLER /p 0._
_DESCR and CONTDESC <obj> <number> allow you to change the text used to
describe an object or what it's containing. These values can be seen when
the object's examined. They're numbers from 1 to about 100, and represent
text such as "A silver <something> lies here." (15) "A mighty stone
<something> stands here." (80) "In the <something> there is " (41). Feel
free to experiment with these, but don't try numbers over 108, as the action
of these is "undefined". The DESCR & CONTDESC of players are saved._
_MAKE "newname" <loc> creates an object named "newname" (which must be a
totally original object name) and places it in location <loc> (as in
MOVE,ZIP). When created it weighs 1 unit, is worthless, and has no
weapon strengths. All this can be changed with WEIGH (see above),
VALUE (see below) and CHANGE (above) The optional syntax MAKE "newname"
<loc> "action" allows you to create mobiles, whose attributes can be
changed by the CHANGE spell. So MAKE "orc5" 1 "sidles" would create the
orc5 in the clearing and when it moved you would be told 'The orc5
sidles out.' (Note also that all MAKE spells are logged - take care!)_
_PEACE forbids all fighting in the game. This is logged._
_REMOVE <obj> allows the destruction of any one object - usually to be used
on something you've created and no longer want. It's the equivalent of
the EXPLODE spell for objects. Try not to REMOVE things important for
puzzles. Largely now superseded by SHATTER._
_RENAME <obj> "newname" renames an object. The same restrictions apply to
the name as in MAKE, above. So does the warning. This spell can also be
used to change players' names permanently. Don't unless asked to._
_SNOOP <play> allows you to see everything that the player sees. This is 
mixed in with your own data, so it's a good idea to be somewhere, like
the Coder's room or Wizards' Room, where you won't be disturbed. Typing
SNOOP on its own will end the snoop._
_SQUASH <mob> is like EXPLODE only messier._
_STOPFIGHT will stop all fights in the location._
_SUPERSNOOP is only for Gods and Demigods, and allows the caster to see
everything that anyone types as they type it. SUPERSNOOP /d will
stop the Supersnoop._
_SUFFIX <play> "<text>" gives the player specified the specified
level name. So SUFFIX BEDIVERE "Elementalist" would make
Bedivere's full name "Bedivere the Elementalist." Only for Gods._
_VALUE <obj> <value> revalues object <obj> to be worth <value> points
(eg VALUE acorn 1000). Making worthless objects into valuable treasures
shouldn't be done lightly, though! This one's logged, too._
_WAR allows fighting again after a PEACE spell. This is logged._
_WEARABLE, FLAMMABLE, BURNS, LIT, EXTINGUISHABLE, TWOHAND, LIQUID <obj>
can only be cast on objects. These spells simply reverse the current status
of an object. So if you want to make the Deathblade you've just created
twohanded and glowing in the dark, do "TWOHAND DEATHB" and "LIT DEATHB".
BURNS means that an object's actually on fire. LIT means that it gives light.
FLAMMABLE means that it'll burn away if you set fire to it, while
EXTINGUISHABLE means that it can be extinguished and relit (like torches).
LIQUID means that it can contain liquids, like e.g. the bottle can._
_WEATHER <num> allows you to change the weather. <num> is a number from 1 to
10 specifying the different kinds of weather there are. Only for Gods._
*
Rangers' Abilities
Rangers have the following special abilities available to them, as well as
having dexterity bonuses in combat, throwing weapons, shooting and stealing._
The commands DEXTERITY, STRENGTH and TRACK are available to Gods & Demigods.
Ranger abilities decrease Concentration (the Ranger equivalent of Magic
Stamina) - you may not use an ability that requires more Concentration than
you have. Sleep, the Philosopher's Stone, etc. restores it._
------------------------------------------------------------------------_
_DEXTERITY <number> allows the user to boost his or her dexterity by the
given amount for a short time. There are limits on the amount, depending on
the user's level. The cost in Concentration is the same as <number>_
_PICK allows the user to try to pick a lock, and costs 5 points of
Concentration. It will not work on some doors and may take several tries._
_RESIST costs 30 points of Concentration and causes the user to develop
an aura of magical resistance: spells will be much less likely to work on
him/her for a short time (a few minutes, depending on his/her level)._
_STRENGTH <number> is the same as DEXTERITY but works on the user's strength._
_STRIKE 3 <area> is an extension to the fight commands and allows the user
to do a combat kick to the specified area. ST 3 will stop any other blow
(for example with a weapon) and if another blow is started ST 3 will be
cancelled. You can't kick and fight in any other way._
_TRACK <mobile> costs 10 concentration points. It allows Rangers to find
out various details about the specified player or mobile, the amount of
information depending on the level of the user._
@
Expressing your emotions
A large number of commands exist in Realm to allow you to show how you
feel. These are listed below._
_(1) Messages across the game. The commands SHOUT, SHRIEK, SCREAM and HOWL
can all be used: these will be heard anywhere in the game. An optional
following message (e.g. HOWL "Aaaaaargh!" can be added). SHOUTing is the
standard long-distance communication method._
_(2) Short-distance messages. The commands SAY, WHISPER, SING and PRAY are
available for this - all are normally followed by a message e.g. WHISPER
"Can anyone hear me?". PRAY is normally only used by Priests, for whom it
has a special effect. Typing the message on its own, e.g. "Hello?" is the
equivalent of using SAY. Prefixing the message by a player or mobile's
name, e.g. BEDIVERE "Hi there" makes sure that everyone knows who you're
talking to._
_(3) Emotes. The commands FROWN, WAVE, LAUGH, CRY, TAP, SMILE, GRIN, GROWL,
SOB, GROAN, BLUSH, CHUCKLE, WEEP, YAWN, HICCUP, GRIMACE, COWER, BOW, KNEEL,
QUIVER, POUT, SHAKE, SHIVER, WINK, BLINK, NOD, SNEER, CACKLE, SNIFF and
GRUNT allow you to behave in the appropriate way. Most can be followed by
