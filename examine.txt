The tome is beautifully illuminated with bright colours and gold leaf, and, 
as it is bound in red leather with gold clasps, it would clearly be worth 
a lot to a collector. Unfortunately it seems to be written in Latin, and 
in any case the script used is so archaic and cramped that you can barely
 make out the letters.

The book appears to be a treatise on the black arts, dealing with necromancy, 
alchemy, thaumaturgy and the raising of demons. Because of its content it 
is valuable but you can make little of the spells and charms it contains.

The badge just says "I'm a city guard" - which is probably untrue.

The sign reads "KEEP OFF THE GRASS!" Underneath, in smaller letters, it adds 
"Failure to observe the regulations is punishable by death. By Order."

Excalibur is a long sharp and extremely magical sword, carved with runes 
and strange patterns. It is well known throughout the Realm that Excalibur 
is an Immortal's weapon, and is enchanted and quite possibly sentient. It 
would be as well to leave it - and its owner - completely alone.

The rod is a short length of ivory, carved with runes, which has the property 
of sending any creature in the area to sleep if waved. It only works once.

The Guardian is a large lumpy life form of indeterminate gender and IQ, 
placed here to stop you getting out of this section of Hamlet's caverns. 
For the cleverdicks who try READ GUARDIAN, it ain't a newspaper, ok?

The charm is a small carved wooden image of some pagan god or other. It's

The hellsword is pure black, yet burns with the unbounded power of evil 
which obviously flows freely from it. Carved on the side in Gothic 
writing is the name 'Nanjusi' which seems to emit a dim red glow.

The messenger of hell is a servant of evil. He wears tight leather 
gloves which twitch impatiently, ready for the kill. You suspect that 
if you incur Nanjusi's wrath, the messenger will deal with it.

The cauldron is a great iron pot, stained black with rust and age. 
Carved around its edge are pictures of various strange objects; a long 
sharp tooth, a skull, a complete skeleton, an image of a god, an egg, a 
five-pointed star and a U-shaped figure which you take to be a horseshoe.

The note's a crumpled piece of parchment. Someone has scrawled the words

The medallion represents the face of a demon of some kind, its features 
drawn up in a savage snarl. It's designed to be hung around the neck by 
a leather thong. Runes scratched on the back read "Medallion of Fear."

The duck seems to be made of gold, but is much lighter than you'd expect -

The idol is about a foot high and made of solid, pure gold - it is 
therefore extremely valuable. It's quite pretty too if you like that sort

The painting shows a high crag, set in a dark and stormy ocean and 
surmounted by some sort of building in the shape of a skull.
