You are standing in a large grassy clearing with tree - stumps dotted around. To the north is a great forest, which spreads round to west and east; to the south is a tall cliff, the north face of a huge mountain, in which is set a strong iron gate. Paths lead off into grassland to the southwest and southeast, and a narrow track leads into the forest to the north.                                                                                                                                                   You are in pleasant forest to the west of a wide clearing. It's quite sheltered here and birds sing in the branches. The forest stretches on to the north and west, but to the south the trees thin out into grassland, and you can see the junction of three paths.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            You are walking through pleasant forest to the northwest of a wide clearing. The wood is not too dense here, though it gets thicker further eastwards. Directly to the east you can see a path.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 You are on the edge of a forest, to the northeast of a large clearing. The trees continue to south, east and north, but to the west a narrow forest path can be seen through the trees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         You are walking through an area of pleasant forest to the east of a clearing. The forest continues to the north and east; to the south and west the trees give way to grass.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    You are standing at a fork in a forest path, just a few paces in from a clearing to the south. The path leads northwest and northeast into the forest; in the northeast direction the forest looks threatening and ominous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     You are walking along a broad northwest - southeast forest path, with tall pines to your west and a tangled mass of thorns and briars to your east. To the southeast the path joins others to make a junction, and to the northwest it leads to a wide glade.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   You are standing in a wide glade, under a huge spreading chestnut tree which towers high above you. You might be able to climb the tree, using the gnarled outcroppings of its bark as footholds to hoist yourself into the branches. Or you can leave the glade via a path southeast, or plunge into the forest which surrounds you in all other directions (except to the north, where some kind of cliff or wall blocks your passage).                                                                                       You are on a long east - west forest path, overhung on its northern side by dark and gloomy trees which block out the light. To the southwest the path emerges into the light and joins others to form a junction; to the east it continues into the darkness. South of the path is a pleasant grove of birches.                                                                                                                                                                                                                You are on a path leading through a lush grassy meadow. The path continues to the west, and meets other paths to form a junction to the east. South of you the ground rises steeply - the northern edge of a large hill - but this is overshadowed by a great mountain further east and southeast. North are the eaves of a pleasant wood.                                                                                                                                                                                      You are on a narrow east - west path overhung by huge dark trees which block out nearly all the light. A deathly silence hangs about you - no trace remains of the birdsong you heard when first you entered the forest. The trees seem to be leaning towards you, reaching for you with groping limbs....                                                                                                                                                                                                                      You are in a small glade in the very heart of the oldest part of the forest. All around you the huge dark trees reach up to the sky, grasping at the light with gnarled and twisted branches, while tangled and distorted bushes in the undergrowth strive with each other for the best position. The malice in the air is almost tangible, and you feel a strong desire to leave this place. You could push through the trees in any direction, and paths lead west and east.                                                  You are plunging through dense undergrowth in a thick forest, deftly avoiding thorns and briars. The forest continues to the north and northeast, but thins out in all other directions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        You are fighting your way through extremely dense forest, avoiding vicious undergrowth and thorns which catch your legs and try to trip you. The forest is so dense here that it completely obscures your view in almost every direction; but to the north you can see what looks like a huge wall of stone - perhaps a cliff - which blocks your way in that direction, while to the west you notice the trees grow less dense and you can enter a clearing.                                                                   You are in a bright, open area of the forest, where the trees are widely spread. The forest continues in all directions except west, where the trees give way abruptly to grassland; to the northeast you notice a patch of tall, melancholy conifers among the deciduous trees of the wood.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    You are in a very dark, gloomy area of the woods. Solemn dark trees stand in silence all around you and a feeling of melancholy pervades the air. To the north you can see the base of a massive towering cliff, and to the south is a path overhung by trees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  You have entered a part of the forest where the trees are very thorny. They rip at you as you push through them, tearing your clothes and skin. The thorns get even denser to the north, making it impossible to continue in that direction, but in other directions they give way to normal trees. To the south you can see a path.                                                                                                                                                                                            You are standing in a grove of very ancient trees. There is hardly any light, and no sound, and you feel an indefinable aura of menace from the trees around you. Southwards you can see a path, and southeast is a clearing; west the woods continue, but to the north a high cliff blocks your way, and further to the east through the trees you can see some kind of stone building.                                                                                                                                        You are walking through pleasant pasture lands close to the south side of a tall mountain which dominates the nearby land. Westwards you can see a well - paved road beside a deep wide river, leading towards a bright city far to the southwest; eastwards a green hill rises from the marshlands further southeast, crowned with some sort of ruined building, and south the pasture lands continue.                                                                                                                         You are fighting your way desperately through evil trees which clutch at you with gnarled branches and try to trip you with roots. The forest is so thick here that you cannot see any end to the trees, except to the east where there is some sort of building visible through the forest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    You are in a very dark part of the forest. The trees here block almost all of the light, letting only a sort of dim glow filter through their tangled branches. To the north is a path; in other directions the forest continues, thinning out somewhat to the west and south.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  You are walking along a grassy path which leads east and west. To north and south the path is surrounded by wide stretches of grass; the path joins another, wider path to the west, in which direction you can see the sea. Northeast is the edge of a forest, and southeast rises a steep hill, while some distance further east you can make out the flat peak of a high mountain.                                                                                                                                           You are in a dim part of the woods, shaded by the tall dark trees all around you. Through the trees to the east you can see a glint of water.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   This is a narrow east-west path through the forest, dark and shadowy because of the great trees overhanging it on either side. To the east is a small clearing, while to the west the darkness is somewhat less; or you could plunge into the threatening woods on either side of the path.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     You are in a part of the forest entirely composed of oak trees. They are all magnificent specimens, and some of them must be many centuries old. To the north you can see a forest path; to the west the oaks give way to birches, while to the east the trees are thicker and more tangled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    This is the northeastern end of a wide stone road which runs along the eastern side of a broad and fast northeast/southwest river. Northeast are the lower slopes of a mountain, from which the river flows; you can cross the river via a sturdy and new-looking wooden bridge, to the west, or you can wander off into pasture land to the south, southeast and east.                                                                                                                                                         You are in a small grove of graceful silver birch trees. Birds sing in the branches and the atmosphere is calm and pleasant. Through the trees to the east you can see the sturdier forms of oaks merging with the birches, and to the west is a junction of forest paths. You can also join a path to the north, but in other directions the forest continues.                                                                                                                                                                 This is a broad stone-flagged east-west road which leads towards a city in the west. The road itself stops here, at the foot of a steep and possibly man-made hill to the east; but steps lead up the hill and you can see some kind of stone building at the top. To the north are pasture lands and to the south is a wet marshy area. Further south you can see the sea.                                                                                                                                                     You are standing on a sandy beach, west of impressive cliffs up which a small path winds. South of here are black rocks; spray shoots up as the sea crashes against them. North the beach continues; west is the sea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           You are on the south side of the woods. This is quite a pleasant spot, with tall trees shading you from the weather and a carpet of thick green moss underfoot. The trees continue in all directions, except to the south where they give way to grasslands. A glint of water can be seen through the trees to the northeast.                                                                                                                                                                                                   You are on the southernmost edge of the forest. To the south you can see through the trees the beginning of rolling grassland. The forest continues to north, west and east, though; through the trees to the northwest you catch the glint of light on water, and to the east you can just make out the form of a large building, partly obscured by branches.                                                                                                                                                                 You are on the east side of the wood, standing to the east of a small dark forest pool overhung by gloomy willow trees. The southern edge of the forest is not far away from here, but to the north the forest grows darker and the trees seem stunted and misshapen. Eastwards through thick foliage can be glimpsed the stone wall of a large building. You can walk round the pool to the northwest.                                                                                                                         You're in pleasant grassland to the northwest of a low hill, crowned with a ruined building of some kind. Northwards are the lowest slopes of a tall mountain; east and west the grasslands continue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           You are on the western side of a deep dark forest pool, overhung by dark willows on the eastern side. In all other directions the forest continues. You can walk round the pool to the northeast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               You are at the northwesterly point of a huge expanse of grassland. To your northwest is an area which has been cleared of trees, and to the north is forest. To the west are the lower slopes of a large mountain which rises steeply to tower above the land; they are not climbable here, but may be scaled further round the mountain to the south.                                                                                                                                                                          You are at the north end of a vast expanse of rolling grassland which stretches off into the southern distance. To the west you can see a mountain which dominates its surroundings. North is the edge of a forest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             You are in grasslands east of a steep and sheer mountain which can be climbed here. To the east, south and north the grasslands continue; further south you can see a low hill, dwarfed in comparison with the mountain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        You are standing in the centre of a great grassy plain, the tall waving grass as high as your waist. To the north you can see the northern downs, and beyond that forest. More grasslands are to the east, partially obscured by a strange mist. Further west from here is a tall mountain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     You are walking on the north downs, a country of short, springy turf and low grassy hills. To the north and further east are the edges of a forest, which spreads across the north of the Realm westwards as far as you can see. Some way west of here the peak of a mighty mountain distorts the skyline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      You are walking in the north part of a quiet grassy valley between low hills to the west and east. The valley continues southwards, while north you can get into open grasslands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               This is a pleasant grassy area of downlands, stretching on in all directions. Further off to the north and east you can see the edges of a dark, gloomy forest, while some way to the west is a high mountain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  You are on the north slopes of a green hill. Further up you can see a ruined watch tower on the summit, and below you a pleasant meadow surrounds the hill. Further north you can see a tall mountain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          You are in a lush meadow not far from the lowest slopes of a mountain which towers to your northwest. To the south is a smaller but still substantial hill, and to the east and west the meadow continues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      You are lost in the magical mist. It billows around you, making strange shapes, and in the distance, muffled by the mist, you seem to hear the sound of unearthly laughter. There seems to be no end to the mist, and no way out....                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            You are on the lower eastern slopes of a tall steep mountain. The surface becomes almost vertical above here, and you will have to climb. You can also get round the slopes of the mountain, to the south or southwest, but northwards they become too steep and treacherous to risk your precious neck on...                                                                                                                                                                                                                   You are clinging frantically to a ledge half way up the almost perpendicular cliff on the eastern side of the mountain. You look down at the dizzying heights below, gulp, and realise you had better move fast. You could edge along the ledge in a northwesterly or southwesterly direction (where the slopes are less steep), or continue up or down the cliff. Above is the top of the mountain.                                                                                                                            You are on the eastern edge of a deep lake at the summit of a tall mountain. In the centre of the lake is a tall black tower, without a visible entrance or windows, seemingly carven out of one vast stone. It juts up at the sky like a blackened finger pointing in malediction. Behind you the mountain drops vertically to form a cliff which only the insane would try to climb; the lake edge continues to the northwest and southwest, though, and you can walk round.                                                  You are on the edge of a deep still lake on the summit of a tall mountain. In the middle of the lake is set a tall dark tower, which casts an aura of gloom over the area; but the view from here is spectacular, and you can see almost the whole of the land, from the forest to the north to the swamps and mudflats at the southern end. The lake edge continues to southwest and southeast, and to the north you could climb down a gentle slope to the edge of a cliff.                                                   You are standing at the very edge of a massive cliff, above a clearing at the foot of the mountain. You have a magnificent view of the forest to the north, which is spread out before you like a map, and turning to the west you can see the moors and, further west, the sea. The eastern view is disappointing, as much of the land in that direction is obscured by mist. To the south the mountain climbs to the summit, to the southeast is a difficult climb, and to the southwest are the western slopes.              You are in green pastures southeast of one wide road and north of another. The southern road leads east towards a hill, while the northwestern one leads beside a wide fast-flowing river northeastwards towards a mountain and a bridge that crosses the river. The two roads converge to the southwest outside the gates of a great city, whose white walls tower above the level of the grasslands.                                                                                                                          You are on the western slope of a green grassy hill. You can go north and south round the hill or west down into pasture lands. Further north you can see a mountain ridge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     You stand on a long road leading east to west. West are the great stone gates of the city, carven with gargoyles and directly to the north is a deep wide fast-flowing river which passes under the city walls (which also block the way to the southwest). South is a field of tilled earth, and another broad road leads northeast.                                                                                                                                                                                           You're crossing a sturdy wooden bridge which leads east and west across a deep fast-flowing northeast/southwest river. Looking northeast you can see the high mountain from which the river flows, while southwest you can see a high city under whose walls it vanishes. To the west are moorlands; to the east is a stone road. A brass plaque on the bridge's rail reads "SOUTH REALM RECONSTRUCTION 31/10/88. LOOK ON MY WORKS, YE MIGHTY, AND DESPAIR!"                                                                    You are on a well - paved east - west stone road leading through pasture to the north and fields to the south; to the southeast the terrain becomes marshy. Westwards, at the road's end, can be seen a great city walled with stone; north, a mountain rises steeply, and east is a lower hill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                You are in a deep rocky ravine, cleft between a hill to the west and a higher mountain to the east. Time has made its mark here, etching great gullies and carving elaborate baroque abstracts into the rock. Your footsteps ring about the ravine, and every slightest sound is magnified. North and south you emerge from the ravine - north to a meeting of ways in grasslands close to a forest, south into bleaker moorlands.                                                                                              You are floundering in the northern end of an expanse of salt marsh. There is a strange bitter tang in the air, and the high pitched cries of strange sea birds echo across the water. Southwards is the heart of this evil swamp, and east is firmer ground; to the north are the southern slopes of a hill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   You are in the heart of the salt marsh, by an evil, black, and stagnant pool, rimmed with scum and slime. There is a foul smell of rot, putrefaction, and decay, and only stinking bogweeds grow in the bitter black soil. From here the marsh spreads like a black stain in all directions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    You are in the western woods, a shady and secluded spot where only a dim light filters through the trees above. West the forest stops, abruptly, giving way to grasslands; east is a clearing bordered by chestnut trees. North through dense undergrowth can be glimpsed a sheer high cliff shaded by the green forest - your way is blocked in this direction.                                                                                                                                                                You are in a thick marsh stinking of decaying vegetation. East is a boring brown expanse of mudflats, and south is the edge of the sea, lapping lethargically at the sticky shore. North is the heart of the marsh, and it continues to the northwest. To your west is foul mud.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                You are at the eastern edge of the marsh itself, though further east the ground is still boggy and treacherous. To the west you can see a pool in the swamp.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    You are knee - high in lush green grass. Some distance to the west the land rises steeply to peak as a high mountain; east of you the grass is thinner and you can see what looks like a large lake of dark water. To the south and west-south-west are low hills, and to the north and northeast you can see a line of trees which must mark the northernmost extent of the grasslands. Further southeast the land is barren and despoiled.                                                                                    This is the southern part of the western slope of a low hill, surmounted by a ruined tower above and to the northeast of you. Some stone steps have been set into the hillside here, leading down to a stone road to the west and up to the crest of the hill. You can walk round the hill to north and south.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  You are in wetlands, where leafy marsh plants grow among the lush green grass. South the flat wetlands stretch away, and west is the marsh proper. North is a drier area, a valley between hills to the northeast and west-north-west. Far off to the south you can see the sea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                This is an area of sticky mud and flourishing green plants on the edges of deeper swamp to the south, west and east. The land around is very flat, (perhaps contributing to the marshiness) but some distance off to the northwest and northeast you can see low hills which must be drier, while further still northwesterly is a high mountain. To the south is the sea.                                                                                                                                                      You're on wet, squelchy land, to the southeast of a low hill and close to the centre of a foul marsh to the southwest. Black water oozes round your feet as you stand here, and the mud gapes at your feet with a soft sucking sound, while a chill and evil-smelling wind blows off the sea and the mudflats further south. This is a desolate place. Further north is drier land, a valley between low grassy hills.                                                                                                          You are on bleak mudflats north of the sea. To the north are dreary wetlands. West and east the brown foul-smelling mud continues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              You are floundering in sticky brown mudflats north of the sea. The mud clings to your feet and seems to be sucking you down.... You can leave, quickly, by continuing west along the coast of the realm (where the mud continues) or by going in any other direction, where the mud gives way to marshes and swamp.                                                                                                                                                                                                             You are in a grey swamp area north of the sea. West and east are sticky mudflats, and in all other directions are flat wetlands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                You are on a high green hilltop overlooking the land. To the east and west are swift rivers, and northwards, a mountain. Far to the west is a marsh, and south are grasslands, wetlands, mudflats, and finally the sea. About you are the ruins of a watchtower; once a stronghold and vantage point, this is now ruined and blackened by fire, and in places little of it remains save the foundations. The hilltop continues south.                                                                                           You are in a grey featureless swamp. North and east this bleak fen country stretches on, its monotony broken to the northeast by a tall white building of some kind. South is a grey and listless sea; west are bleak mudflats. Gloom pervades this place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      This is the centre of a wide grassy plain stretching off to the north and south. Southwest and southeast are two low grassy hills which you can ascend; some way northwest is a much higher mountain. In the northern distance you can see the edge of a forest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                This is a low grassy knoll which rises a few tens of feet above the surrounding grasslands. To the west you can see, across a valley, another, larger hill, this one topped with a watchtower. The high ground continues to the south; to the east you can descend into polluted and broken land, surrounded by slag-heaps, and head towards a dark and evil-looking lake.                                                                                                                                                      You are in the northernmost reaches of the fen country. To the north is a low hill and further west there's another with a high mountain behind it; but in all other directions the country is flat and featureless, except to the east, where you can see a high white tower further south and a black crag to the north. Southwards the ground slopes down to meet the sea.                                                                                                                                                   You are in the southern part of a low green valley between gently sloping hills to west and east. South the ground becomes wet and marshy, but northwards the valley continues, opening out into featureless grasslands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        You are in fen country. Further north and northwest are hills, and off to the east you can see what looks like a lighthouse (though you can't be sure, because the whole area is veiled with thin mist); southwards you think you can hear the sound of the sea, muffled and faint.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             This is the southern part of a low knoll in a wide expanse of grassland. West is a similar hill; a burnt-out tower stands on its top. South is fen country, bleak and unprepossessing, but the land to the east is worse still, being burnt and broken and strewn with ashes, the remains left by some vast destruction. Further east a tall crag or cliff rears from the ashlands.                                                                                                                                             You are on the east slope of a green hillside. Above, on the summit, is a ruined watchtower. East across a valley is another, lower, hill, and further east you can see a ruined and desolate land.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             You are in a large field of freshly tilled and fertile earth east of the city walls and south of a wide paved road. Fields continue south and east. Further south you can see the sea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          You are in a field, once ploughed and fertile but now covered with rank weeds. Off to the west is another field, followed by the city wall; east the fertile land trails off into salty marshes. Southwards you can see the sea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Here the fields from the east trail away, and there is only black and salty soil, where the sea washes listlessly. North are the curtain walls of the city; further southeast the mud continues, and to west, south and southwest is the sea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   You are in a fertile field, overgrown by weeds, which continues to the north and northeast; to the east the fields trail away into salty marshes. In the northwest corner of the field squats a stricken oak, twisted, malformed and baleful. Behind it is the southeastern corner of the city wall.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            This is is the northern part of the east slope of a low green hill. East is a valley, followed by a similar knoll; you can walk round this hill to north and south.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             You are on the south slope of a green hill. North, above you, is the summit; south are swamplands, and you can walk round the hill to west and east.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            This is plain, fertile pasture land, to the north of a stone road and to the east of a low grassy hill. Further north are the lowest slopes of a mountain. Beyond the road to the south are swamplands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         This is the southern summit of a low grassy hill. Immediately to your north are the ruins of a watchtower, destroyed by fire; further north you can see a tall mountain, while east is a hill of a similar size to this and beyond that a wasted barren land. Below, to the west, is a wide road leading towards a tall city; steps lead down to it. And looking to the south you can see across the acres of barren swamp to the sea.                                                                                          You are among tall pines, with a carpet of green needles underfoot, patterned by shafts of daylight. Birdsong ripples from high among the branches. East is a beaten track through the forest, and southwest more open woods than these. Southeast through trees you see a clearing, and further a grey mountain looms against the skyline.                                                                                                                                                                                     You are at the summit of this mountain, by a calm lake from which rises a tower of black stone which glisters strangely in the daylight. West, at the foot of the mountain, is a deeply cleft ravine, and further, a green hill crowned with monoliths. North the treetops are laid out like a tapestry, while south a river flows from the lake and cascades down the mountainside to a seashore city in the southwest, preventing you from going round the mountain this way.                                                 You are on the western slopes of a mountain. Above you is a steep climb to the summit, but below and to the west the ground suddenly drops away, forming a deep ravine. Attempting to descend would be extremely foolhardy. The slopes of the mountain continue to northeast and southeast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     You are at the summit of the mountain, by a still lake. Southwest, and far below, the pleasant landscape is gashed, a deep ravine, beyond which is a green hill topped by standing stones. Northeast, at the foot of the mountain, is a clearing, in the forest that stretches north and northeast. Southwest are wild moorlands, and then a port city, and then the sea, blue - green in its shining waters to the horizon. From the lake centre rises a tower of such blackness that it seems to drink in the daylight.       You are on the mountain's lowest slopes. Southwest you can get down onto moorland, but southeast a river cascades down the mountain slope in a shower of foam and spray, blocking your way completely in this direction. You can continue along the mountainside to the north, though.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          You are on the southern slopes of a tall mountain, rising steeply from the flat lands around you. Immediately to your west is an impressive sight; here a river gushes down the mountain slope, roaring and sending gouts of spray upwards as it crashes among the rocks. It is obviously completely impossible to progress round the mountain in this direction, but you could go eastwards, or of course you could head up or down the mountain. A stone paved road is to the southwest.                                      You are at the top of the mountain, by a quiet lake, from which rises a tower, black and absolute. Although the lake is well walled in, nearby to your west a gash has been broken in the wall and through it a torrent of water gushes, away and down the mountainside, preventing your going round the mountain in the direction. You could continue eastwards, though, or go down again.                                                                                                                                     You are at the summit of the mountain, by a calm lake, from which rises a gleaming black stone tower. The lake is walled all around with stone of a similar type, to prevent its escape. You can go round the lake to the west or the east, or return down the mountain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        You are halfway down the southeast side of a tall mountain which juts steeply from the surrounding landscape. Southwards, at the foot of the mountain itself, a small hill rises from the surrounding grasslands, crowned with some sort of tower.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              You are on the lowest southeastern slopes of a tall mountain. You can safely walk round the foot of the mountain to the west or the north, or go down and south into a valley between this mountain and a low green hill. Southeast are grasslands, and further off another hill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               This is a junction of three grassy paths in meadows at the foot of a mountain and just to the south of a great forest. The mountain, to the east and southeast, is too steep here to scale, its slopes a vertical cliff; but you can go round it via two of the three paths leaving here. Either south through a ravine formed by the mountain and a lower - but still steep - hill to the southwest, or northeast into a great clearing by the north face of the mountain. The third path leads westwards into grasslands.     You are walking under the eaves of a great forest, stretching away to the north and east. To the south and west are grassy areas; south you'd join a path leading east-west through a meadow. Some way southeast a mighty mountain breaks the skyline, dominating the area around and dwarfing a smaller hill due south of you.                                                                                                                                                                                                 You are on the edge of an area of pleasant woodland which covers most of the north of the land. The forest deepens rapidly to the east, but thins out to the west into scrubby grassland. Further west you can see the sea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     You are in a wide expanse of grassland to the west of a forest, filled with the rustling and chirping of small creatures and insects. To the west you can see a cliff, while to the south a path leads through the grass.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       You are standing in an area of rough grass south of an immense cliff, which towers up for what must be at least a hundred feet of sheer rock. The height is dizzying and obviously quite impossible to scale. Set in the rockface - almost undetectable - are the outlines of a great stone door. In other directions, the view is less awe - inspiring; to the east is the edge of a forest, to the south the grassland continues and further to the west is the sea.                                                          You are standing on the cracked and broken flagstones of what must once have been a great northeast - southwest road. Now grass and weeds grow on it. To the southwest it joins another road, in slightly better repair. To the east and south are pasture lands; the road runs alongside and parallel to a fast-flowing and turbulent river, in a deep gorge to the west, and beyond it you can see moorlands. The river is uncrossable here, but there's a bridge to the northeast.                                           You are in sparse and scrubby grassland, rapidly degenerating into the heather and gorse of a barren moor to the south. To the north is a path, beyond which - northeastwards - you can see the edges of a forest; to the southeast a hill rises, topped by a circle of standing stones,and overshadowed by a great mountain which dominates the eastern skyline. To the west can be seen a cliff, and beyond that the sea.                                                                                                     You are wandering on lonely moors to the east of the sea, dotted with heather and gorse. To the east the monotony is relieved by a high hill which rises steeply from the surrounding land.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     You are walking across a wide, bleak moor, which stretches on to north, south and southeast. To the east a hill rises steeply, to the west is a cliff edge and beyond that the sea, while directly south of here is a tall cairn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               You are standing by a cairn of rough irregular stones on a bleak moor. A chill wind whips across the moor from the west, coming off the Sea which lies not far off in that direction across the scrublands. Off to the southwest you can see what seem to be the walls of a city at the edge of the land, while northeast is a low hill, dwarfed by a mountain behind it. To the southeast you can make out a broad river winding its way across the moor; you might be able to cross it further to the east.                   You are standing in the centre of an area of desolate moorland, where only heather, gorse and clumps of thin grass grow. The moors stretch on in all directions, bounded further to the east and southeast by a broad river which flows from a tall mountain far off east-north-easterly. Closer, to the north, is a low hill with some sort of stone building on top of it, and across the moors to the southwest you can see the walls of a citadel.                                                                          You are at the southernmost extent of the moors, which come to an end here against the walls of a proud city to the southwest and a fast wide river to the south, which flows into the city. The river is much too wide to cross here, though you can see fertile and green lands on the farther bank. The moor continues to the east, and to the west is the edge of a cliff.                                                                                                                                                  You are at the furthest southeastern point of the moors - progress further in this direction is blocked by a fast river coming from the northeast, where it flows from a high mountain. Across the river you can see fertile and green lands in sharp contrast to the bleakness of the moors, but the river is much too wide and deep to cross. The moors continue to north and west; northwest you can see a cairn.                                                                                                            This is the most easterly part of the moors. Here a path runs across the otherwise featureless moorland, leading north through a ravine between a high hill (to the northwest) and an even higher mountain (to the northeast) and east across a bridge which crosses a deep and fast river which flows down the slopes of the mountain. The moors continue to the west and (following the bank of the river) to the southwest.                                                                                                  You are on the southern slopes of a bleak hill rising steeply out of the surrounding moorland. Looking upwards you can see a circle of standing stones on the crest of the hill. To the east the ground is too steep and treacherous to venture on, dropping steeply to form a ravine between this hill and a much larger mountain further east.                                                                                                                                                                                You are standing on the western slopes of a steep hill above barren moorland. Across the moors to the west you can see the place where the land falls away beyond it the sea stretching to the horizon. Looking south you have a good view of a river which curves round from somewhere to your east to flow westward across the land and into what looks like a largish walled citadel. Beyond the river is a wide road and past that what looks like marshland. North of you the moors continue.                              You are on the lower north slopes of a bleak hill, rising steeply from the flatlands around it and bearing only stubbly grass. West and southwest the land is much the same, but north and northeast are paths leading through greener meadows, and further north the edge of a forest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         You have come to the northern end of a cliff path which runs all along this western side of the Realm. Not more than a few feet from where you stand the ground falls perpendicularly to a sandy beach far below, and you can look down to the sea beating against jagged black rocks further south along the coast. Directly to the north, and blocking your way, is a high wall or cliff made (built?) of grey stone, though through the long grass to the east you can see what looks like a door of stone in the wall.      You are close to the top of a barren hill, and from here can see plainly the stone circle which stands on its crest to the south. To the east the ground is steep and dangerous, dropping steeply to a deep ravine before it rises again as a mountain whose size is far greater than that of this hill. You can go to the west, though, where the hill slopes down gently to moorlands before you reach cliffs and the sea, or to the north, where you can see grassy meadows and then a dark forest.                          You are standing on a narrow ledge of slate above a deep ravine on the eastern side of a barren hill. The ledge projects out over the chasm and you can look down at the dizzying drop, and across to the east at the bare grey side of the mountain which rises perpendicularly from the ground below before its slope becomes less steep - hundreds of feet above you - and it climbs upward to a flat top. The only exit from here is a scramble up the eastern slope of the hill - tiny in comparison - to its own summit.  You are at the summit of this bleak hill, an evil-looking place obviously used for some dark ritual in the Realm's distant past. Around you loom great grey monoliths, encircling and enclosing you, and at the centre of the circle there is a flat black stone, worn smooth, polished, and tainted with many rust-brown stains. You can descend to the west and south towards the barren moors, to the north to meadows and wooded land, or to the east - a dangerous climb down to a ledge above a deep ravine.              You are just below the summit of a barren hill. Above is a circle of standing stones, while below are purple moors and then the Western Sea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    You are below the summit of the hill, and can now see clearly the circle of grey stones which surmounts it. To the east the ground falls away steeply to make a deep ravine between this hill and a mountain further east. To the south are dreary moors, and beyond them to the southwest a white-walled citadel on the edge of the Sea.                                                                                                                                                                                       You are walking a precarious path along the edge of steep cliffs. Below, the sea crashes against jagged rocks, and looking further out, you can see the vast expanses of boundless ocean stretching out to the misty horizon. The cliffs and the path continue to north and south, and northwest an extremely unsafe path leads down the edge of the cliff. To the east another path leads off into grasslands.                                                                                                                 You are on a grassy cliff path, leading north and south. To the west are dangerous cliffs, and looking down you can see a sheltered cove - indeed an almost inaccessible cove, as no-one would dare the jagged rocks connecting it to the beach further north. To the east is moorland, and further east a bleak hill.                                                                                                                                                                                                          Here the cliff path comes to an abrupt end: south are high city walls. East are moors, in which a cairn of grey stones has been raised.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         You are walking gingerly along a narrow ledge hewn into the cliff to your east. It slopes down to a sandy beach below, and up to the edge of the cliff. Thousands of seabirds are all around you, screaming their hoarse cries over the roar of the sea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        You are in a large room with carven stone walls and ceiling, lit by a gentle glow which seems to be all around without a definite source. To the east an ornate and rune - enscribed door is set in a stone archway. In the floor strange and occult symbols surround a large pentacle. All around you can hear the sound of running water.                                                                                                                                                                                     You are standing in the centre of a dark and gloomy cave, dimly illuminated by the light from an iron gate to the north. The air is dank, cold and very still, but listening intently you seem to detect a dull booming sound, distant and faint. A tunnel hewn from the rock slopes downward and to the south, into the darkness.                                                                                                                                                                                              You have been thrown into the Wizard's Dungeon, an area designed to hold malefactors and those who disturb the peace of the Realm (though it is misused occasionally...) Looking gloomily about you realise that there is little chance of escape : the only exit is a shaft set in the ceiling, 30 feet above, through which a dim light filters. A notice reads "DON'T QUIT!"                                                                                                                                                 You are in a vast stony hall with little light, and stony walls which drip and ooze. South of you is a great stone door, and north is a dark narrow stone walled passage, through which a chill wind blows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     You are in a narrow stony jagged passage which narrows even further northwards. Here the ooze and slime on the walls has frozen solid, giving the whole passageway a loathsome appearance. From the north is a glow of daylight, and also a bitterly cold wind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 This is a deep gorge with a curious aroma. South you see dank and gloomy caves, and north a narrow way from the ravine, into a landscape consisting almost entirely of ice and stone. East and west the steep walls of the gorge, hung with icicles, press so close together that you can barely see the grey leaden sky above.                                                                                                                                                                                                 You are in a small niche in a rock face. The snow has settled deeply here, and mounts in drifts on the narrow ledge to your east. Above you the rock face is too steep to climb.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                You are in deep snow on a cliff ledge. West is a niche in the cliff face, but you cannot continue further east, nor can you ascend, nor can you descend without breaking your neck. You have a fine view from here; first a snowy plateau, then a steep hill of ice. Further north a chasm, and still further, at the far end as the cliffs close in, a dark castle guarding the pass, and east and west the black harsh cliffs closing in to the northern end.                                                                 You are in a hollow in the cliff face - deep, but no protection from the wind, which still catches you full in the face. North is a chilly - looking waste, glittering with ice and frost, with a harsh yet not altogether ugly appearance, quite delicate, even. Above you is a scramble up the north cliff face, jagged, possibly, painful, and more than a little dangerous, to a niche set deep in the rock.                                                                                                                Here the cliff rock, though hard, has given way, and hundreds of tiny black pebbles and needle - like splinters of rock are half embedded in the snow, and here and there, some hard black rocks and boulders, some of a considerable size. West and south are snowy plains, and southwest is an area of ice and cold winds. Passage east is blocked by the dark (if somewhat crumbling) cliffs, and northwest is the corner of an icy hill, too steep to climb.                                                                Here, you are almost hemmed in on every side, south and west and southwest by the harsh black cliffs that provide so much of the scenery here in the North, east by a lower cliff, more jagged - you realize that that must be the west side of Stilton Gorge, and north by an icy hill, almost vertical and much too steep to climb. There is only a gap northeast by which you could exit, and this gives you a view only on snowfields until the invariable black cliffs.                                                    This is a gully between cliffs to north and south and east. From the east, and lower cliff a waterfall has flowed, but now it is still and solid, frozen into ice by the cold of this land. In it glitter many strange or valuable objects - some half hidden and merely a glitter of gold, others more visible; a crown, a chairleg, and a great deal of household rubbish - all trapped in the ice and out of your reach.                                                                                                     You are on the highest point of an icy hill. West is the sheer cliff face, and north and south the ice slope is too steep to descend safely, so if you wish to leave you must make your way down eastward to the lower slopes of the hill. From here you can see to the north a chasm, and beyond that a dark castle guarding the North Pass.                                                                                                                                                                                   This is a niche between an icy hillside to the south and curving to the east, and the blank black face of the cliff to the west. South you could perhaps climb the hill, but there seems to be more scope to the north. Although north and northwest after a while you would come to the brink of the chasm, the cliff which now blocks your way to the west falls away there, while northeast there seems to be a way to skirt the chasm altogether.                                                                           You are on the northern slope of an icy hill, the summit being to your west. The wind blowing here is exceptionally sharp and cold, coming as it does from the north. North also you can see snowfields, to which you could descend, a deep chasm, and still further north a black castle guarding the Northern Pass, before which lie the snowy Coldlands. South you can travel over the brow of the hill to return to the southern snowlands and Stilton Gorge.                                                               You are in flat snowfields, sheltered slightly from the wind by an icy hill to the north, which curves around to the west. South are more and harsher snowfields until the cliff foot, but it is the north hillside that is of most interest, although unlike the side to your west, it is too sheer to climb. Set in this surface is what appears to be a cave of ice, glowing from within, but unfortunately the entrance is blocked by a sheet of hanging icicles, frozen iron - hard.                                       You are in a magnificent and lofty cave of ice, illuminated by faintly glowing walls. The ceiling here is particularly splendid, hung with icicles, some so large that they merge with the icy floor, and all faintly luminescent. Also, in the centre of the floor there once ran a fountain, which now is frozen into a curious natural sculpture like nothing so much as candlewax. The chief beauty of this cave, however, is that it offers complete shelter from the wind.                                                You are in a narrow rocky ravine between high black cliffs to north and south. The ravine bends southwest, or you could follow the ravine eastwards, where it seems to lead to a more open space.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               You are in a gap between cliffs so dark and monotonous that you can barely see the narrow gap to the west, and it is equally difficult to see exactly where the black cliffs end and the stormy skies begin. This is a most unpleasant and gloomy place, and with a most uncanny echo.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          You are in snowfields in a corner of the black cliff which prohibits your movement both east and south. You can, however,go on to other coldlands north, west and northwest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    You are on the southern slope of an icy hill just below the summit to the west. You can go north, over the brow of the hill, or you could descend to snowfields east and south. Southeast, however, the descent would be too perilous to attempt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               You are in deep snow south of an icy hill. Northeast and southwest are more snowfields, while east is a grim and frosty looking area, and south you can see along Stilton Gorge to the dark caves at the southern end. To your west looms a dark and impassable cliff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          You are in an area whose principal feature is cold. Bitter cold, deathly cold, freezing, marrowchilling cold, colder than charity, with a wind from the Arctic Circle with an edge like a knife. The snow here is layered with ice which rings like iron beneath your feet, and you can make out the outlines of footprints where the ice has hardened still further. North and west are snowfields, east has been a rockfall with stones half buried in the snow, and south is a niche in the hard black cliffs of this area.  South of the chasm and north of the cliffs, where they meet at the far western point of the land. From here your view into the chasm is most spectacular, a great torrent of molten lava cascading down the high western rocks and flowing, boiling, eastwards. Sulphurous yellow steam billows upwards, making you cough and choke.                                                                                                                                                                                            You are south of a yawning chasm in which a river of lava flows eastwards. North of the chasm you can see crags and coldlands, east and southeast are snowfields, while west is an area also overlooking the chasm, in part obscured by steam.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  You are south of a chasm and northwest of a steep and unclimbable icy hill whose face here is almost vertical. North of the chasm are coldlands, with a dark castle at the far northern end, east also are coldlands, south are the last of the snowfields, and west you can progress between the chasm and the dark cliffs as far as you can see, for the far end is shrouded in yellow steam or smoke.                                                                                                                        This is where the chasm (which almost splits the North in two) comes to its eastern end, the river of lava disappearing below ground, and the chasm dwindling to a few mere cracks in the rock. Exits from here are north to a craggy area, west alongside the chasm, and southwest to the last of the snowfields. Exit south is blocked by a sheer icy hill, and east by the black cliffs that are the border to this land.                                                                                                    This is where the chasm meets the cliffs at the west end. You can see from here where, at the west end, from the black rocks, a torrent of lava cascades down into the chasm and flows eastwards, and south of the chasm you see an area shrouded in yellow steam. Beyond that to the southeast is an icy hill. From here you can go east or northeast to coldlands; a dark castle is further north.                                                                                                                            You are in coldlands north of a chasm in which a river of molten lava flows (further southeast you can see where the river disappears beneath ground into a cave). West you can continue alongside the chasm, east the ground falls away too steeply to descend, and north, northeast and northwest are coldlands before Hamlet's Castle.                                                                                                                                                                                       The ground is broken and cracked here, and just to your south the chasm dwindles as the river of lava plunges into a cave. North and west the rock rises too steeply to climb, so you can only go east. There is a deep fault in the ground here, black, and you cannot see the bottom. It is not too narrow to climb, but too steep, almost perpendicular, and with too few handholds.                                                                                                                                         You are in a fairly anonymous location, identifiable only by its surroundings; east a narrow northeast way between cliffs, north and northwest coldlands, and west a slope down to a furrowed area. The chasm ends some way southwest of here, and northwest across the coldlands you can see the castle guarding the Northern Pass.                                                                                                                                                                                            You are in a northeast - southwest gap between cliffs which now turns east. West, outside, are coldlands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       You are in bleak uninspiring coldlands southwest of Hamlet's Castle. Northwest is a niche in the black cliffs of this northern area.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            You are in a niche in the cliffs before a small stone door to the north, carved with a lion's head with two empty stone eyesockets and a keyhole at the back of its open mouth. Beneath is an inscription - 'Hamlet's caverns - abandon hope all ye who enter here'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            You are in coldlands south of Hamlet's castle. Further south you can see a chasm, but all around you are bleak and monotonous coldlands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        You are in coldlands southwest of black cliffs and southeast of Hamlet's castle. This location has no features of interest whatsoever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          You are at the gateway to Hamlet's castle, a great wood - and - iron affair, with Hamlet's monogram painted on in black. About you stretch barren coldlands, south to a chasm from which a great steam rises.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   You are between cliffs to your north and south, in a fairly broad open passage to a structure of ice at the eastern end. There is a way out southwest from here between the south cliff and a sheer steep ice hill to the west.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 You are clinging frantically to the meagre handholds to be found in the sheer black walls of a circular pit. Although evidently hand and footholds were once cut in the rock, they have been worn almost completely away - presumably by frequent use. This is not a place to stop and admire the view, as you will soon lose your grip; you could, however, haul yourself up over the edge of the pit and to safety, or descend into the depths below.                                                                         You are walking along a wide man-made rock tunnel which slopes downward to the south and upward to the north, whence you can detect a glimmer of light. Southward the darkness is absolute and nothing can be seen. A whisper of cold air blows up the tunnel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  You are standing in a vast subterranean hall deep beneath the mountainside. Its black walls, smooth and polished as glass, soar upwards to a vaulted and arched roof many hundreds of feet above. Every sound you make is magnified and reverberates about the cavern, making you feel extremely exposed despite the millions of tons of rock all around you. Illuminated by your flickering light you can see an upward-sloping tunnel to the north and three sinister black archways to west, east and south.                 You are in a small alcove below a flight of spiral stairs which lead up into darkness. To the west a tall archway, hewn from black stone as are the steps and the very walls of the chamber, leads into a vast space of impenetrable blackness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 You are in a short east - west passage with a low roof, hewn from glittering black rock. To the east the passage passes though a high archway into a wide chamber of some kind, while to the west a low flight of steps leads deeper underground.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               You have entered a large room almost completely filled with life - size stone statues of every kind. They seem to be made of the same black, glittering stone as the walls, ceiling and floor, and are incredibly lifelike in their execution. All seem to have been captured in the middle of some action, as if frozen in the stone. Archways of the same black stone are to the south and north of this chamber.                                                                                                             You are on a flight of spiral steps which lead both up and down from here. The treads of the stairs are slippery, being made from stone worn smooth by countless feet. All around is darkness and silence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      You are now in a narrow hallway whose walls, ceiling and floor are made from stone so brightly polished as to act as a mirror. Myriad reflections dance around you, distorted and weird, and make you dizzy and confused. You are no longer sure where you came in, or how to get out....                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       You are on a flight of broad, shallow stone steps leading down a roughly hewn tunnel. Further down the tunnel levels out and becomes smoother; above you the impenetrable darkness makes it impossible to see what may be there. The steps are worn, as if used by many feet, and the ceiling is very low; so low, in fact, that you have to stoop, and you wonder if this way was made for humans at all....                                                                                                                   You have entered a small and roughly - hewn rock chamber. The main exit is to the north, but set in the centre of the floor is a deep shaft, which plummets downwards into the darkness. Although its sides seem smooth, it might be worth risking the descent. The only other feature of interest in this bare chamber is a rusty iron lever which protrudes from the rock wall. Its purpose cannot be guessed, but it might be possible to move it...                                                                         You are at the north end of a dusty tunnel with a very low ceiling, leading north - south. To your east a flight of broad low stone steps lead upwards. Further south you can see a light at the end of the tunnel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             You are on a flight of narrow, steep and well-worn spiral steps which lead up and down from here. Your light can only illuminate your immediate surroundings, and you have no way of telling in its flickering light how far you have come or how far there is yet to go....                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    You are roughly half - way down a rough and low - ceilinged rock tunnel which leads north and south. To the north the passage comes to an abrupt end, but to the south it widens out into a well - lit cavern. From this direction you can hear the sound of hammers ringing on stone; perhaps this tunnel leads to a mine of some kind.                                                                                                                                                                                        You are on a flight of steep spiral steps which lead both up and down. At this point in the staircase a small window has been cut in the west wall, and through it you can look down on what is clearly a vast stone hall. Your light casts immense shadows as you try to see more clearly, but you are so high up that the floor of this chamber is invisible to you. The height is dizzying but the view of the high vaulted ceiling magnificent; from here strange carvings can be seen in the glittering black rock.        You are on a section of the spiral staircase which seems to go on for ever. There seems no break in the monotony of the steep, slightly worn steps and the gleaming black stone of the walls. Maybe there is no end to the stairs; maybe they stretch on in all directions, with no escape....                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  You are on a small landing on the spiral stairs, which continue upwards and downwards from here. To the west is a rune - inscribed door, and to the east is a thick glass window, beyond which you can see fishes swimming. You seem to be in a room just below the surface of a lake. Faintly you hear the sound of running water, punctuated by the occasional splash.                                                                                                                                                        You are on a flight of spiral stairs, lit from above by what seems to be daylight; a fresh breeze blows down from above. To the west is a stone archway leading off the stairs, which go up and down from here, into a daylit chamber. Below you the stairs lead down into semi-darkness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       You have reached the top of a tall tower, and above can see the light of day; in comparison the spiral stairs leading down seem dark and sinister. Looking over the battlements of the tower reveals a breathtaking view; the tower, high in itself, is set in a lake on a mountain top, and the whole of the land can be seen, from the forests of the north to the southern mudflats and from the eastern mists to the western ocean. A tiny city gleams at the mouth of the western river flowing from the lake.             You are in a medium-sized, brightly lit and well-furnished chamber on the west side of a tower. A window looks westward across a lake and the western slopes of a mountain, and further to a green hill crowned with stones and the sea on the horizon. In contrast to this peaceful scene the room itself is engraved with strange and evil magical symbols, indicating that the occupant of this room is a being of some power.                                                                                               You have entered a wide natural cavern, lit by many torches hanging on the walls. In their light you can see that this cavern is in use as a mine; marks of hammer and pickaxe are on the walls, and the floor of the cavern is covered with rock chippings of all sizes. Looking upwards you can see a wooden gallery with small figures at work on it, and you hear faintly the ringing of hammer on rock. Small tunnels lead off to the southwest, northwest and southeast, and a larger tunnel leads north into the dark.   You are in a narrow northwest - southeast tunnel with a low roof, hewn roughly from the rock. To the southeast it broadens out into a wide and well - lit cavern, while northwestwards it winds onwards into the rock. To the southwest is a heavy metal door.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  You are moving with difficulty along an extremely narrow and low northwest - southeast tunnel roughly hewn from the surrounding rock. Although this section of the tunnel is dark, there is light to be seen in both directions; to the southeast the warm, flickering light of many torches, and to the northwest the paler light of day. To the southwest of here a portcullis is in the doorway of a dark room.                                                                                                              You are standing in an alcove at the end of an extremely narrow passage from the southeast. In the western wall has been cut with great craft a narrow window looking through the rock; from the outside it must be invisible, but looking out you can see over a wide ravine to a green hill crowned with standing stones, and beyond the sea. You are surprised at how high you are in relation to the ground; clearly you are looking from the side of a high hill or mountain.                                              You are in a small stone room with only one exit, a door to the northeast. This room is clearly a store room for gems and other treasures from the mines; however as production has been falling off lately, not much remains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  You are in the second of two store rooms intended to contain the gems and other treasures extracted from the Kobold Mines. A small square stone room, it has only one exit, a heavy iron portcullis to the northeast; clearly intended to keep intruders such as yourself out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  You are in a short tunnel which runs northeast - southwest. To the northeast it widens out into a large and well - lit cavern, while to the southwest it enters a narrow and high cavern, shrouded in darkness. Judging from the crashes and thuds coming from this area, some work is at present going on in there and it might be as well to tread carefully....                                                                                                                                                              You have entered a narrow yet very high cavern. It is almost as though you were walking along the bottom of a deep northeast - southwest fissure. Indeed, as you look up, you see torches moving in the gloom far above your head, seeming to indicate that some mining work is afoot up there. The rubble of rocks and boulders which lie all around you shows that stones are being dislodged from above and hurled into the cavern, presumably to clear some high passage.                                                   You are at a dead end, at the southwestern extremity of a long narrow cavern which runs northeast - southwest. There are signs of mining work having gone on here, too, but this area seems long disused, and you guess that this area of the mines has been worked out long since and abandoned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               You are in a wide but low passage leading northwest - southeast. To the northwest the tunnel enters a large and well - lit cavern, while to the southeast it continues into the darkness. From the northwest comes the sound of hammers on stone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               You are roughly halfway along a low - ceilinged and rocky northwest - southeast tunnel. This appears to be a natural passage rather than man - made; water drips from the roof and stalactites hang down. The tunnel continues into the dark in both directions, though from the northwest a faint glimmer of light can be seen. To the northeast a small hole in the ground plunges downward; you might be able to crawl down it.                                                                                              You have reached the end of a tunnel from the northwest. Here work has been done recently on extending the tunnel, as you can see by the rock chippings strewn across the floor. However the diggings have been abandoned; there is very little of interest here, and you may as well go back the way you came.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 You are crawling along an extremely low and tight fissure in the rock. You can only inch along slowly and painfully, as this passage is not designed for humans to pass along. Your light can only show you a few inches in front of your face, the darkness is so intense; but you can see that the crawl slopes upward to the southwest and downward to the east.                                                                                                                                                             You are on a steep slope covered in stones, making it difficult to maintain your balance - especially as the ceiling is so low at this point that crawling is the only method of progression. Further up this area narrows into a twisty crawlway, while downwards and to the east your light glints on water - perhaps an underground lake, to which you might be able to slither down.                                                                                                                                        You are standing in a wide cave on the western bank of an underground lake. Although your light does not show much of the surroundings, you can see that the cave is large and high, and that the lake stretches on a long way to your east. From far off in this direction you hear a faint splash and gurgle of water, and surmise that this is the sound of the streams which fill the lake. The only other way out of the cave is a scramble up a steep scree slope to your west.                                           You are standing in freezing cold water on the western edges of an underground lake in a huge cavern. Looking around you you can see the majesty of this area; huge stalactites hang from the ceiling while stalagmites protrude from the lake. Far above your head you can see a dark circular opening, whose purpose is unguessable. Looking back at the lake you can see that eastward the water becomes too deep to go any further on foot. Westward is the edge of the lake and dry land.                                  You are standing in icy water at the north end of an underground lake, set in a huge natural cavern. The water here is quite shallow, but east it gets deeper, preventing passage that way on foot. To the west the lake laps against the rocky walls of this cavern, southwards the lake continues at the same depth as it is here, and northwards is a narrow opening in the wall, half filled with water; it might be possible to squeeze through. Far off to the east, invisible in the gloom, you hear running water.      This cave was evidently once part of the system of the upper halls; its walls, like many of those on higher levels, are of a glittering black stone, unlike the rough rock of the cavern to the south. However water has since filled the chamber, coming through a wide crack in the southern wall, and is up to your waist as you wade through the room. One interesting feature of this chamber is an extremely rusty iron lever, protruding from the wall at eye level. Exits are south or north down a passageway.         You are in a tunnel with walls of glittering black stone, sloping downwards to the north and upwards to the south. Although originally part of a larger system, the tunnel has filled with water, which is already at shoulder level, making it difficult to move; progress further north is probably unwise, as the slope of the tunnel means that the water will have filled it completely in that direction.                                                                                                                 This is the furthest it is possible to progress down the tunnel; further north the water fills the passage completely, and even here it is lapping about your neck. The only way out is back up the tunnel, to the south; and as the water is icy cold and you are already shivering ominously, it might be a good idea to go in this direction.                                                                                                                                                                                You are clinging to precarious handholds in a narrow rock shaft which leads vertically both up and down from here. The hand and footholds are barely sufficient to allow you to maintain your grip; you can feel yourself gradually slipping... you had better move. You can obviously move up or down the shaft; alternatively you might be able to reach from here a tunnel to the north, allowing some escape from this pit.                                                                                                 You have reached the bottom of a deep rock shaft and are standing on a small ledge. Although the shaft itself has ended, you are still above some huge empty space, and though your light cannot show much of the darkness, it is clear that there is an area of water some distance below. Whether this would break your fall if you let yourself drop, you cannot tell... if the idea of finding out does not appeal to you, you can return up the shaft by using the worn footholds and handholds cut into the rock.         You are on the brink of a deep and narrow shaft, to your south, which seems to lead both up and down from the point at which the passage you're standing in leaves it. The passage leads northwards, into gloom; like the shaft, the walls of this passage are made from some black rock, hard as granite, which seems to drink in the light; so you can get no indication of what may lie ahead, save that you seem to hear, from the north passage, a faint sound of running water.                                           This is a part of a dark rock tunnel, which stretches off to the south. To the north a flight of steps leads downwards; a breath of damp and chill air seems to blow up the stairway towards you. A third exit is offered by a small door, made from some yellow metal, to the east.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            You are near the top of a long dark underground stairway, sloping downwards to the north and upwards, where it joins a passage, to the south. The air is damp and cool, and a thin layer of condensation has formed on the stone steps, making them slippery and hard to negotiate. Further down you can hear a faint sound of running water.                                                                                                                                                                                   You have entered a comfortable and well - furnished room, lit from above by some unidentifiable source. The walls are panelled wood and the floor is carpeted; at the eastern end of the room is a desk of some gleaming dark wood and a large armchair. Glass-fronted bookshelves, securely locked, line the eastern wall. Altogether this room presents a stark contrast to the dark tunnels outside. The only exit is a brass door to the west.                                                                              You are at the western end of a wide east - west passage, deep underground. To your south a flight of steep black stone steps lead upwards into darkness, while to the east the passage continues. From this direction you seem to feel a breath of cold and damp air; you can also hear the sound of running water, faint but clear, from the east.                                                                                                                                                                            You are in the lower galleries of the cave complex; here an east - west passage is joined by a tunnel from the south. Northwards the black stone of the wall has been cut away to make a narrow window through which you can see a huge cavern, part of the mines; far below tiny torches gleam in the gloom, and you can hear the sound of hammers on rock. Apart from this the only sound is that of running water, coming from the southern tunnel.                                                                          You are in a north - south tunnel carved from black rock, sloping downwards slightly to the south and meeting a junction to the north. In the east wall of the passage a fissure has opened in the rock, and water trickles through it; perhaps an underground stream has broken through the wall of the tunnel. The water runs away to the south and you can hear it splashing into some large body of water, which, you guess, must block the passage further southwards.                                                     You are standing ankle - deep in cold and scummy water, at the end of a downward - sloping passage from the north. There is no way to continue, because the passage here meets a flight of steps which are already underwater; trying to descend would soon mean that the water would be above your head. You must return from here back the way you came.                                                                                                                                                                      This is an area of grasslands north of a wide stone road and some distance to the east of a river running northeast/southwest. To the east a gentle hill rises, while to the north towers a high mountain, from which the river is flowing. Southwards, across the road, you can see a wet and marshy area; northwest is a similar road running beside the river.                                                                                                                                                               You are in the western end of a large area of evil-smelling salt marshes, continuing to east and south. To the north is a wide and well - paved road, and to the west the ground is drier and weeds are growing. Southwards you can see mudflats and then the sea. To the northeast is a low hill surmounted by what looks like a ruined tower.                                                                                                                                                                                 You are in a sticky, muddy area between fields to the west and the salt marsh proper to the east. This area is bleak and lifeless; nothing could grow here. A foul stench comes from the mud.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   You are on the west of a wide salt marsh; mud oozes beneath your feet and black water bubbles from the ground beneath you as you move. The swamp stretches on to the east and north; in all other directions is evil-smelling mud.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              You are at the western end of an area of mudflats which stretch across most of the southern coast of the realm. This is an extremely dull and unprepossessing area; even the sea, lapping at the mud to the south, seems dull and listless. The only creatures to get anything out of the area seem to be the herring gulls, clustering in great flocks here to search out food, then wheeling off with harsh cries as you move. To the northwest the ground is drier, but everywhere else is mud.                              You are on mudflats to the north of the sea. North and northeast the mud gives way to a salt marsh; in all other directions it continues, except for the barely perceptible change where the land turns to water to the south.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  You are on winding stairs in the abbey church, just below the tower top. While you rest here you hear the flapping of thick leathery wings, and indeed the whole stone stair is spattered with bats' droppings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 You are in a stone room halfway up the abbey tower, a room with four high stone windows. Through the north window you can see trees crowded against a high cliff; to the west the forest stretches on, and east are more trees lost in a strange mist. Through the south window you look over the slate roof of the abbey; southwest and southeast is the roofing of the nave and chancel of the abbey church, but it is crumbled away where the arches of the dormitory begin and gone from the chapter house and infirmary.   You are on the spiral stairs of the abbey tower. They are dark, but above you you can see shafts of light.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      You are in a square stone room north of the abbey church, thick with dust and desertion. Thin high slits  of windows let in shafts of  daylight from the north, west, and east. A spiral stair winds upwards, and there is a heavy oak brass bound door to the south. On the sand of the floor the bones of owl pellets splinter beneath your feet, but the owls themselves have flown from this tower.                                                                                                                         You are in the nave of the church, the western end, simple, bare stone, the rich hangings stolen long ago for sale to fill the purses of vagrant adventurers, the roof high above, plastered, but the paint faded. Further east is the chancel, but here the south wall has crumbled and collapsed, letting you out of the abbey church and into the cloisters, and from that break of stone bright light floods in to illuminate the dark church.                                                                              You are at the centre of the abbey church. To your west is the nave, blazing with light from a broken south wall, to your east the chancel, and to your south the south aisle. To your north is a heavy oak door, carved and bound in brass, but the brass is tarnished, and the oak stained and smeared with some dark liquid - blood....?                                                                                                                                                                                     This is the west end of the chancel. East you can see at the far end of the chancel the shattered remains of the great east window, and there is broken glass underfoot even here. Further west you can see daylight flooding in from a break in the south wall of the nave.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    You are below the arches of the great east window - the stained glass is shattered and fragmented upon the stone flags, where the window once cast great pools of coloured light, crimsons and blues and greens and golds, and the monks would have knelt, in the hours when the great bell called them to prayer, and the hymns and scent of incense rose to the ceiling and faded like smoke, and the spiders did not spin between the columns of stone.                                                                      The west wall is broken and the west side roof has fallen almost completely, and light pours in upon the deep cracks between the stone flags. All that remains of the west wall are a few jagged splinters of stone, and beyond these are the grassy cloisters. South is a doorway to the dormitory, but the great door is broken from its hinges. Looking closely at the flagged floor you seem to detect one stone different from the others...                                                                               You are in the crypt beneath the south aisle. The floor is paved with memorial tablets, and ranged about the four walls are four marble tombs, on three of which lie marble crusaders, their stone hands folded upon their swords, their helmeted heads supported by marble lions. The fourth crusader is absent, and as the crypt is hardly hospitable, it might be wise to emulate him; a trapdoor in the ceiling leads up to ground level.                                                                                   This is the far north end of the dormitory, where the walls and arches are still intact, and there are still the jagged remains of a roof over your head. Further south, however, there are only the broken stubs of stone pillars, and the roof of the dormitory is fallen in and littering the floor until the far south end. To your north is a doorway into the abbey church, but the door itself has been torn from its heavy iron hinges. To the east you can pass under the archway and into the ruined chapter house.   The slates of the roof are fallen in here and litter the flagged floor. To your east the wall and great arch still remain, to the west there is not even a stump of stone or a pillar's base to show where the walls went, and you can pass into the grassy cloisters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          You are in the long narrow north - south dormitory. To your east there is still half the archway into the infirmary, west there are only two broken stone columns, and then the cloisters. Here, as north and south of you, the flagstones are littered with roof slates, and the long room is open to the sky.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The main features of this place are the two pillars east and west, one twice the height of the other. This part of the dormitory is in particularly bad repair, with weeds and grass growing up between the paving stones, and smashed roof slates. At the southern end of the dormitory the roof remains, as it does at the northern end. Beyond the western pillar are the cloisters, and to your east is an area overgrown with thorns and trees, and seemingly cloaked with a white mist.                                   A grey stone wall and a roof above your head, and to east and west stone arches, east to a grassy area that used to be the west end of the Abbot's house, and west to the ruins of the refectory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               You are in woods east of darker, denser forest. In the east are the remains of a ruined abbey - southeast the corner of the cellarium, northeast the walls of a gatehouse, and directly east a more lightly wooded area before the nave of the abbey church. North, south, and west, nothing but forest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        You are in the chapter house, where the monks went about their daily business. Although the arch to the dormitory at the west end still stands, there is no roof, and the wall is crumbled away, leaving window arches without keystones and almost the whole of the south wall crumbled away, the area to the south wooded and overgrown. Beyond these trees you can see where the north wall of the infirmary has given way also and all the crumbling stones are carpeted with mosses and lichens.                           The north wall has been reduced by time to a few grey stones overgrown with briars and a bundle of moss, the south wall so crumbled that you could easily climb it, the roof a few broken grey slates that litter the floor. Only the east wall is mostly undamaged: beyond you can only see mist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              You are at the east end of the abbot's house, where there is still a roof and three grey stone walls at least. To the west all is gone, the walls ruined, the roof caved in and fragmented, the floor no more than a mat of grass until the arches of the dormitory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            This is where the monks used to dine. The south wall is intact, as is the wide arch from the dormitory. The west wall is gone, however, dramatically improving the access to the kitchens which lie in that direction; and only a small portion of the north wall remains, jutting upwards towards the sky. Northwest and northeast you can enter the cloisters by going round this piece of stonework; or you can enter the dormitories to the east.                                                                           You are in the kitchens, a long grey building whose main feature is a great open fireplace at the south end. The tall chimney, however, has collapsed, as has the roof. You can go east into the refectory, climb over a broken wall to the west, or to the north there is a small low door into a dark room.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   You are in the guesthouse, a long stone half - roofed building with a single doorway to the west, although you could also clamber over a ruined wall to your east. The room is bare apart from a pile of damp straw in the corner, on which lies a grisly jumble of bones and soggy rotting fabric, showing how here at least one visitor found some rest.                                                                                                                                                                      You are in deciduous woods below the abbey church tower to the east. To the west is the low door of the almonry and to the south is the long north wall of the nave. In all other directions are more woods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    You are in a long dark room with a high roof and only one low door, to the south. Various decaying and unidentifiable debris lines the walls, and the stone-flagged floor is stained and scratched, but there is nothing of real interest here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 You are in the grassy cloisters, a peaceful timeless place without worry, where the monks used to come to be silent. To the west is a wall of the cellarium, and to the east the ruined walls and arches of the dormitory. To the north is a break in the wall of the abbey church nave, and to the northwest you can leave the cloisters for the  surrounding forest.                                                                                                                                                          You are in what remains of the gate house. The north and south gates have collapsed, as have the west wall and the roof. There is still, however, a small low doorway to the east into the almonry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             You are in the almonry, where the monks used to distribute alms to the poor. It is a small low building, with two small low doors at the east and west, to woods and the gatehouse respectively. Apart from these conventional exits, there is also a break in the south wall, through which you can see more of the forest.                                                                                                                                                                                                    You are in thick woods south of a dark cliff. South, west, southeast and northeast are more woods, but to the east are the remains of a building, a gatehouse, and further east you can see a tower rising from among the trees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                You are in woods south of the cliff and north of the gatehouse and almonry. To the southeast are more woods through which you can catch glimpses of the abbey church, and there are also woods southwest and east.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              You are in deciduous woods below the abbey church tower to the south, and south of a dark cliff. East and west are more woods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  You are in misty forest north of the church chancel and east of the tower. To the northwest are more woods between the tower and the cliff to the north. To your east and south is a sort of grey white swirling mist, into which you cannot see.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               This is the very top of the abbey church tower. From here you can see the woods to the west and the mist to the east and the forest before the cliffs to the north, and the whole abbey laid out below you, the chancel, nave and south aisle of the church, and then the dormitory, the chapter house, the infirmary, the abbot's house, the cloisters, the refectory, the kitchen, the guesthouse, the cellarium and directly west below you the gatehouse and the almonry.                                                   You are in dark forest to the west of the guesthouse. North, south and west are more woods, those to the south being misty and difficult to see. Eastwards you can enter the guesthouse through a low stone arch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               You are in misty woods to the south of the dormitory and abbot's house. North there is a break in the abbot's house wall, but in all other directions the woods continue. To the east they seem to look brighter and less gloomy, and you seem to see some kind of clearing through the trees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  You are in thick misty woods southwest of the guesthouse. North, west, and east are more trees, and to the south the woods fade into grasslands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                You are in misty woods to the south of the kitchens and guesthouse. To your west, east and south are more woods, those to the south looking unhealthy, withered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                You are in misty woods overgrown with briars and littered with grey stones, where the walls of the chapter house to the north and the infirmary to the south have collapsed. To the east a grey-white mist obscures your view; to the west are the walls and arches of the dormitory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           You are walking in quiet cloisters. To the west is the wall of the cellarium, and to the south the last piece of the north refectory wall juts upwards like a broken tooth (you may walk around it southwest or southeast). To the east are a few broken pillars where the dormitory wall used to go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           You are in misty woods south of the refectory wall. To the east, south and west are more woods, the trees to the south looking withered and stunted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            You are in misty woods north of the abbot's house, south of the infirmary and east of the dormitory. These are so broken down that you could enter any one of them. To the east is a swirling mist: you cannot see beyond that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 You are in woods nearly boxed in by abbey buildings; to your north the gatehouse and almonry, to your south the cellarium and to your east the nave of the abbey church. However there are more woods if you go between the nave and almonry northeast, and southeast you can enter the cloisters. The south gate of the gatehouse is broken, but you can still pass through into the small building.                                                                                                                           You are in a wooded area which used to be the west end of the abbot's house. East some of that building still remains, north and south are more woods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          You are in a forested area west of the cellarium. In all directions except east there are more woods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           You are in quiet grassy cloisters. To your west is a wall of the cellarium, to your east the walls and arches of the dormitory are broken and you may enter. To your north and south the cloisters continue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    You are clinging to crevices and cracks in the rough bark of a great chestnut tree. It is not easy to climb it here, but higher up it splits into several branches which could afford some safety; or you could slither down to the ground.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Here two great branches split off from the main trunk, and you are able to pull yourself onto one of them and sit astride it, looking down to the glade perhaps twenty feet below. The daylight shining through the tangled and bare branches above does little to light up the forest around you. From here you can return to the ground by going down the trunk, or climb higher; or you can go along one of the two great branches, to the west and east.                                                                    You are crawling along a wide branch about twenty feet above the ground. Above you the tree's smaller branches are outlined black against the bright sky, and to your east is the broad trunk of the chestnut tree whose branch this is. Further west the branch is too slender to bear your weight; but you have a good view here across the western end of the forest, and through the firs and tall beeches you glimpse the flash and glint of light on moving water, for in that direction lies the sea.                    You are crawling along the lowest eastern branch of a mighty chestnut tree whose main trunk is to your west. Below you - some twenty feet or so - you see a small glade in the forest which surrounds you; above is a tangled mass of bare branches. Eastward the branch continues; it should be thick enough to bear your weight.                                                                                                                                                                                              You are about halfway up an enormous chestnut tree, and already the ground - such of it as you can see through the tangled branches below - is far away. Branches protrude from the great trunk in all directions, and although these provide useful handholds and footholds they cannot hold your weight for long - only the greater branches down below could do that. In fact, these branches are more of an obstruction than anything else, as you have to push through them to get anywhere from here.                     You have come to the eastern end of the lowest eastern branch of a great chestnut tree in the heart of the forest. Further east the branch will not take your weight. From here you can see across the forest to your east; a gloomy sight, for the eastern woods are for the most part dark and evil, and even sunlight does little to lift their shadow. Through the tangled trees you can see the shape of an old building; beyond it lies mist.                                                                             You are now close to the top of a tall chestnut tree, and in places above you you can see patches of sky through the mass of tangled branches that is otherwise all around you. Just next to you here, in the hollow between a branch and the main trunk, is a huge untidy nest, filled with dirt, feathers and bits of twig. The occupant must be around somewhere - and bad luck is what you don't need right now, some eighty feet or more above the ground...                                                               You have come to the very top of the chestnut tree, and, clinging precariously to the slender branches, a view of the Realm spread out below you. To the west and east you can see the forest, extending around you on every side; further west is the sea, and further east the ruins of an abbey. Northwards you can see the top of the high cliff that blocks travel in that direction, a narrow catwalk before it plunges downwards again to a cold and snow-covered land.                                                  You are passing under the great gatehouse of the city. Westwards you can see along a dusty cobbled road to an open square; eastwards are the tall city gates, sturdy oak studded with brass and reinforced by metal bars. To your south is a small alcove, set in the gatehouse's mighty stone walls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           You are walking briskly along a wide cobbled east-west street running between tall buildings, locked and barred to prevent your entry and seemingly deserted. To the east the street leads out of the city towards a strong gatehouse, while to the west it continues towards the town square. Southwards a narrow alley leads between buildings.                                                                                                                                                                               You are walking along a broad cobbled street between tall forbidding buildings, east of the town square. The town is deserted and the silence is deathly; you tread carefully for fear of disturbing some spectre of long ago. Eastwards the road leads towards the exit of this uncanny city.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  You are in a small alcove. North of here is a low door which would allow you to leave, or you could ascend a flight of steps; above you you can see daylight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   You are near the top of the flight of spiral steps which allowed the guards, in the days of the city's glory, to gain access to the gatehouse top from the guard alcove below. But these stairs cannot have fulfilled their original purpose for many a year now, and dust lies thick on the stone treads. Above you is daylight.                                                                                                                                                                                               You have come to the top of the great gatehouse, main bastion of the city defences in the days when its lords were supreme rulers of the Realm. You can look through the arrow slits, see the holes where boiling oil would be poured, lean over the high battlements where - if all else failed - the defenders would grapple hand-to-hand with their opponents. But all is deserted, and looking over the western wall you can see the signs of decay in the great city. You can go down, or north or south along the walls.  You are on the section of the northern city wall closest to the gatehouse; from the narrow walkway that used to allow the guards to patrol the walls, you can look eastwards over the road that leads into the remainder of the Realm. Westwards, leaning over the battlements, you can see houses, and nearer the wall, a tavern. You can continue along the wall to the north.                                                                                                                                                You are on a narrow walkway on top of the city walls, running north-south. From here you have a good view - looking west - of the northern section of the city, while eastwards you can see across the southern part of the Realm. The walkway continues in both directions; further south it leads onto the gatehouse.                                                                                                                                                                                                         You are on a walkway on the top of the northern city walls, above the West River which flows under the wall and into the city here. Here, too, the city wall bends sharply westwards, so that to leave this part of the wall you can go either south or west.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   You are on an east-west walkway along the top of the northernmost end of the city wall. Northwards, looking over the battlements, you have a view down to bleak moorland, and northwest cliffs, while in sharp contrast to the south are the palace grounds and the spires, domes and minarets of the palace itself, once the centre of the Realm.                                                                                                                                                                              This is a dead end, since a building has collapsed across the street to the south. You may return northwards. Alternatively there's a small nondescript building to the west whose entrance is a shimmering wall of light - clearly some sort of magical portal - which you could try to pass through.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          You are at the northwestern corner of the city walls; the walkway leading to this location goes south and east from here. Looking westward over the battlements you can see the sea washing against the cliffs below; the western wall is on the very edge of the Realm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        You are on a north-south walkway leading along the western part of the city walls. Below and to the west is the sea; to the east is the western part of the palace. Southwards along the walkway the wall ends in a round tower.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                You are at the top of the northern tower, built to defend the city from attack by sea. It overlooks the harbour - to the south - and the sea washes against its lower western and southern walls. It is joined to the north by a walkway which leads along the length of the main city wall, designed to allow guards to patrol it. The only other exit is down a ladder to the lower level.                                                                                                                                    You are in the lower chamber of the north tower, which in bygone days defended the city harbour from attack. Now, however, it is cold, damp, and decidedly chilly; a cold wind blows from the sea to the west and whistles through the arrowslits. A door leads east, but it is jammed and cannot be opened; perhaps something is blocking it from the other side. The only exit, therefore, is a ladder which leads up onto the top of the tower.                                                                              You are on a north-south walkway leading along the top of the part of the southern city walls nearest to the gatehouse to the north. Eastwards, leaning over the battlements, you can see fields and - further - a marsh. West you look across the roofs of a maze of small houses and twisting backstreets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    You are walking along the top of the city walls. The walkway between the battlements continues to north and south; further north you can see the main gatehouse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                You are on a part of the southern city wall which curves west in one direction and north in another. Looking southeast you can see over fields and mudflats to the sea, while northwest over the battlements you can see the roof of an intriguing granite building, seemingly without doors or windows, which has escaped the destruction vented on much of the rest of the city around it.                                                                                                                                    You are walking along an east-west walkway on top of the southern city wall. Southwards you can look over fields towards the sea, while northwards you can observe the desolation wrought on the once proud city. Buildings lie in ruins all around this area - the roads are blocked by fallen masonry, and here and there are great pits and chasms in the earth. Some terrible catastrophe must have overtaken the inhabitants to wreak such destruction.                                                                    You are at a sharp corner in the city wall where it bends north and east; walkways lead along it in both these directions. From here you can look across the great western ocean to the west and southwest; but looking southwest an ominous sight catches your eye. A mountain, remote but clear, rises from the sea in this direction; and from its peak trails a faint plume of smoke. Here, surely is the agency that has wrought the destruction in the city below. An active volcano!                                     You are on a north-south walkway, leading along the top of the high city wall. North of here the walkway leads onto the top of a round tower, while south it bends east; west you can look over the sea as it washes against the base of the wall, and east you look down over the battlements onto a street and some relatively undamaged buildings.                                                                                                                                                                           You are on the top of a large round tower which in former days would have guarded the harbour from attack, together with the North tower on the other side of the harbour. It is based partly in the sea, which washes round its lower walls to the north and west; to the south a walkway leads onto the city wall, and a ladder allows you to descend to the lower level.                                                                                                                                                     You are in the lower part of the south tower, built to guard the harbour from attack. Since the destruction of most of the city it has been disused, and it too suffered in the eruption of the volcano; part of the upper western wall has been destroyed and cold wind and spray from the sea blow in through the gaping hole. A door leads out of the tower to the southeast, and a ladder allows you access onto the roof of the building.                                                                                  You are in the city square, dominated by a statue of some forgotten hero on a high plinth. The square is strewn with chunks of rubble from the destruction of the city; but it is still a quiet and a pleasant place, the silence only broken by the sound of birdsong and by the murmur of the distant sea. Roads lead from the square to the north, south, east and west; in all other directions the way is blocked by tall buildings.                                                                                       You are on a north-south cobbled road south of the city square. Further south it joins other streets to form a crossroads. East are tall buildings, locked and boarded up since their inhabitants fled the city; west are the ruins of a building destroyed in the city's fall.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 You are in a small cobbled square where four roads meet to form a crossroads. In the middle of the square a fountain used to play; but now it is choked with dust and part of the basin has been broken away. Rubble litters the ground from the ruins of a large building to the northwest; but in most other directions the buildings are unscathed. Boarded-up houses are to the northeast, to the southwest is a shop of some kind, and to the southeast is a large granite building, seemingly without an entrance.        This is a short north-south road ending abruptly at the edge of a deep chasm in the earth to the south, too wide to jump. To the east and west are the walls of large buildings, blocking movement in those directions; so you must return north.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               This road leads into the winding backstreets of the City to the east, or west to a crossroads. To the south it passes a large and imposing granite building, whose purpose is unguessable; its windows are high and narrow, and the single door in its walls is impossible to open.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             This narrow alley leads between tall gloomy buildings, south into the maze of the backstreets or north onto the main city road.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 This road, so named because of the many warehouses (now mostly ruined) which used to stand on its southern side, runs east to a crossroads and west to a three-way junction. Northwards is rubble from the destruction of some large building, which you can cross.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             This is where Tower Street, running north-south, is joined by Warehouse Road to the east. Tower Street runs parallel to the western city walls, and further north you can see the tower that gives it its name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 This is the northern end of Tower Street; it ends at the door of a tall round tower, part of the city defences. East and northeast are the ruins of a large building, west are the city walls, south is the junction of Tower Street and Warehouse Road and north and northwest is the South Tower itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      This east-west road is - or used to be - the main street of the city. Along here would roll the wagons laden with goods from the many ships that anchored in the city port; along this street would walk the warriors, adventurers and magicians who had bought their passage to the Realm to seek adventure. Now it - and the rest of the city - are deserted and silent.                                                                                                                                                      This wide north-south street, running between elegant houses to west and east, joins the city square to the south and crosses a river to the north. Eastwards a narrower road leads off the main street.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        You are standing amid rubble and broken masonry in the centre of a large expanse of ruins. Perhaps once some great mansion or temple, this building must have suffered a direct hit from the lava of the erupting volcano; only a couple of marble columns remain, pointing forlornly at the sky. To the northwest is the edge of the city harbour; in all other directions (except northeast, where the way is blocked by buildings still standing) you can get onto one of the city's roads.                                  Here you would once have come, if you had lived in this city while it still throve and grew, to buy almost anything that you could have needed. Everything from basic foodstuffs to the most esoteric magical ingredients could have been found here. Unfortunately, when the city fell, this made it a perfect target for looters and robbers, and so very little of any use remains on the broad mahogany shelves or the wide marble counter. The only exit is through a doorway to the northeast.                            This is the west end of Harbour Street, where it meets Chandler's Street running north and south along the edge of the harbour. Steps lead down from here into the murky water.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 You are crossing the river which flows through the city, going over a mighty stone bridge made in the days when the city was powerful. It arches up high above the water, carven with gargoyles and curious stone faces which stare and leer from the rock. North and south is normal road again; further north you can see the domes and high towers of a palace.                                                                                                                                                              This narrow east-west street runs between various small shops, most locked and closed to keep out intruders. Silver Alley was so named because of the trading - buying and selling, haggling and bartering - that went on here once. But there is little sign of that now. West Silver Alley joins Palace Street, and east it continues.                                                                                                                                                                                        This is the north end of Chandler's street, bounded by the city river to the north and the edge of the harbour to the west. East you might be able to get into a derelict warehouse, and south Chandler's street forms a junction with Harbour Street.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          These are the steps which lead down to the dirty water of the harbour and up to the street running along the harbour's edge. They were built to allow people with boats to come and go between the greater ships that were once moored in this harbour - and without a boat you will not be able to go any further in this direction.                                                                                                                                                                                           You have come to the southern end of Chandler's Street, and the southern end of the quayside. There is very little here of interest, apart from the sea to the west and the rest of the street to the north; in all other directions are ruins, though across them to the southwest you can see a round tower.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  You have come to the northernmost end of Palace Street, and have reached a high fence of metal railings which cuts off the palace grounds from the rest of the city. Two wrought-iron gates stand to the north, but although they were once firmly padlocked and formed a barrier they are broken down and do so no longer; you can pass through them on to a tree-lined avenue leading up to the palace.                                                                                                                       You are on an east-west road, between two largish shops that seem to have been left unlocked and have not been damaged by the catastrophe that devastated so much of the rest of the city. To your north is an armourers, to your south a shop whose sign reads "Curios and Antiques." To the east Silver Alley comes to an end, and to the west it joins Palace Street.                                                                                                                                                        This derelict warehouse once housed many of the exotic treasures that were brought back by ships from distant countries. Since the fall of the city, though, it has been looted many times and partially burnt, so that little of any great value remains. You might find something if you look, though...                                                                                                                                                                                                                      This is the end of Silver Alley; you cannot go any further east, because of the city walls, and the shop to the south is boarded up and inaccessible. To the north, however, stands a disreputable-looking tavern, whose sign realistically shows an orc swinging his morningstar towards the viewer. Above the open door is written the name of the inn "The Ball and Chain". If you don't like the look of this you can head westwards down the road.                                                                         The Armourer's shop was one of the most important in the city in the time when it was a meeting-point for adventurers and heroes. The brackets you see on the stone walls would have held a wide range of swords, axes, maces and polearms for those who wanted to face the Realm's many dangers. Obviously since the city's fall these weapons have been much in demand and have been scattered about the land, but you might find that one or two have been left behind. You can leave the shop to the south.                 You have entered a fairly large shop which once sold antiques and curios in the days when there was a buying market for such things. However this shop, like most of the buildings left open in the city when its inhabitants fled, has been looted and as a result most of what is left in here is mere worthless junk. The only exit is to the north.                                                                                                                                                                         This is the "Ball and Chain" tavern, once frequented, in happier days, by all the warriors, thieves, mercenaries and adventurers of the cityport. It seems to have escaped the fall of the city and the chaos that followed reasonably structurally intact, as far as you can tell. You can lean on the bar and chat here - assuming there's anyone to chat to - and there's even a tap here from which you could fill yourself a glass of beer. The only exit is the street door to the south.                                 This is a room where the Coders, Gods, Demigods and so on store the objects that may be useful at some point in the game but are not at the moment. It is designed as a sort of adjunct to the Wizard's Room to keep its burden down. Mortals are DEFINITELY not allowed in here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               You have come to a relatively clear part of the backstreets and are standing in a small square in the corner between the eastern and southern city walls. Nestling against the southern wall is a small shop, whose sign reads "Irata and co. Suppliers of quality gems." The door is open and you may enter; or you may go back into the maze.                                                                                                                                                                                 You are on the outskirts of the maze of backstreets and there is a way to leave it altogether by following a dark alley northwards between two large buildings. Or you can go into the backstreets to south, west and east.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     You are on the western edge of a maze of twisting turning backstreets. A road to the west offers some escape or you can go deeper in to the east.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               You are wandering in a maze of twisting turning back streets, all alike, which seem to go on for ever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          You are wandering in a maze of twisting turning back streets, all alike, which seem to go on for ever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          You are in a maze of twisting back streets which seem to go on for ever. You are disorientated and cannot find any familiar landmarks, nor can you be certain as to the direction from which you came.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          You are hopelessly lost in a maze of sidestreets and back alleys, which twist and turn as far as you can see. Your sense of direction is confused and you cannot be sure of finding your way out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               You are wandering in a maze of twisting turning back streets, all alike, which seem to go on for ever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          You are in a maze of twisting back streets which seem to go on for ever. You are disorientated and cannot find any familiar landmarks, nor can you be certain as to the direction from which you came.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          You are hopelessly lost in a maze of sidestreets and back alleys, which twist and turn as far as you can see. Your sense of direction is confused and you cannot be sure of finding your way out.

You are in a maze of twisting back streets which seem to go on for ever. You are disorientated and cannot find any familiar landmarks, nor can you be certain as to the direction from which you came.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          You have entered a small and poky shop. For some reason this shop was not raided when the city fell - perhaps because the raiders couldn't find their way here - and so most of the contents are intact, though some are in disarray, as though the owner left in a hurry. Unfortunately most of the metal cases on the walls are securely locked and bolted, so you can't get at their contents...                                                                                                                             This is the northern end of the beach, bounded to the north and east by high cliffs and to the west by the sea. Looking far out in this direction you think you can see a small island. The beach continues to the south.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       You are scrambling about on the north edge of some black rocks, wet and slippery with sea spray. North is a sandy beach and west is the sea. South the rocks continue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          You are climbing over sharp and spiky black rocks, slippery with seaweed and water, west of a tall white cliff. Above your head gulls wheel and scream, darting down to the sea to the west to catch fish. Further north the rocks end.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         You are scrambling over wet and weedy rocks west of a tall cliff. West you can see an interesting rockpool; further south the rocks slope down to a small beach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                You are at the southern end of a group of slippery black rocks. Further south is a small sheltered sandy cove, and west is the sea, crashing against the rocks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 This sandy cove, sheltered on both sides by cliffs, is a strangely quiet and peaceful place. The sea, which crashes against the black rocks to the north, rolls in quietly to the west; even the screaming of the gulls seems distant and faint. To the east is a tall cliff, grassed on the top, and with a small passage in it - naturally carved by the sea - which you might be able to crawl down.                                                                                                                         You are crawling down a narrow east-west tunnel, lit dimly from the west. Further east it seems to broaden out, but it is too dark to see clearly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              You have entered a rounded natural cave, tall enough to stand up in and with a smooth sandy floor. It is entered by a narrow crawlway from the west and has no other exit. In your flickering light you can see that this would be an ideal place for someone to hide treasure; but maybe somebody else has thought of this first.                                                                                                                                                                                              You are on the southern side of a large area of black rock, being splashed by the sea as it batters against the edges of the rock to the south. Further north you can see a large rockpool; east are cliffs, and northwest the rocks continue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  You are by a large and interesting rockpool, filled with curious weeds and fishes; through the clear water you can see crabs scuttle across the stony bottom. Anemones fringe the edges of the pool, waving their tentacles at the tiny crustaceans swimming through the water. West and east, north and south, the rocks continue; further west is the sea and further east cliffs.                                                                                                                                            You are on black rocks, close to the sea to the north and an interesting rockpool to the south. The rocks continue to the west and the east; to the east is a tall cliff while westwards the rocks eventually give way to sea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  You are scrambling over a particularly slippery and treacherous area of black rocks, part of a larger area which juts out into the sea to the west. The sea blocks travel to the north, unless you have a boat, but the rocks continue in most other directions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                This is the southern edge of a large area of black rock, jutting out from the main coastline of the land to the east into the sea to the west. The sea splashes against the rocks to the south, making it impossible to continue that way on foot (and even if you do have a boat, it might not be a good idea to put out to sea so close to the rocks) but in other directions the rocks continue.                                                                                                                             You have reached the northwestern edge of the black rocks, and without a boat you cannot get any further to north or west, but must return eastwards the way you came. But this is a good place to look across the sea, to see - you think - tiny islands set in the gleaming water of the vast ocean, and to wonder what strange things might lurk in the emptiness of the sea.                                                                                                                                                Here is the southwestern edge of the black rocks, and you can go no further to south or west without a boat - and even if you did have a boat, it might not be advisable to put out to sea so close to these dangerous rocks. But you can look out from here across the sea, see the tiny islands set like jewels in the bright ocean; and far to the south-south-west you can see a mountain, remote yet clear and somehow menacing, from whose peak a faint pall of smoke rises.                                              This is the eastern end of the harbour of the city, and a small flight of stone steps lead upwards to dry land further to the east. From your boat you can see the high buildings and stone towers of the great city, almost as if it was still inhabited; and you can imagine the days when this port was the gateway to the realm, and tall, stately ships or slave-rowed galleys would come here from far away bringing cargoes of treasure.                                                                                 This is the mouth of the city harbour; further west is the open sea, while eastwards it is possible to get onto dry land. North and south you are flanked by high stone round towers, built to defend the city from attack from the sea in the days of its glory; looking east you can see the ruins and desolation that overtook the city, leaving little of the southern part standing; and far off to the southwest you can see the agent of that destruction, a remote mountain with a little smoke coming from its peak.   You are close to the southern side of a group of tall and jagged rocks which block progress further north - nobody in their right mind would risk certain death by rowing any closer. The sea continues to west and south, and east you can get in to dry land and safety.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      This is the northern part of a small desert island, and here is the only visible sign that mankind has ever taken any interest in this dry and inhospitable place. A tall tower stands close by, made from some strange black stone and apparently without either doors or windows - its purpose is unclear, except that it might of course contain something of value - if you could get inside. Apart from that, the sea is to the north and a group of palms to the south, and you could always walk round the island W or E.This is the east side of a small island, and to the east the sea washes gently up the sandy beach. West of here you can see a small group of palms, and further north round the island's coast there is a tall black tower without any visible entrance. You can also walk round the island to the south.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       You are struggling to keep your small boat from being dashed against vicious black rocks to your east and south. It is obviously impossible to try to land here, though you could possibly row round the rocks to north and south and in that way get to dry land. Or you could head out to sea, to the west.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   You are close to the southwest side of a group of vicious black rocks at the base of a tall white cliff to the east. You have to row with all your might to keep from being caught up and dashed against the rocks by the waves; and it is obviously impossible to land here, though you could head round the rocks to the north or south, or of course head west out to sea.                                                                                                                                                   You have reached the safety of a relatively calm and safe area of water, just to the west of a pleasant-looking sandy cove where you could land without danger. The cove is flanked with cliffs on all sides except where it is open to the sea; in the cliff wall directly to your east you think you can make out a small tunnel, perhaps the entrance to a cave, which might be worth investigating. North of here are dangerous rocks, but south and west the sea appears reasonably safe.                                  This is the south beach of a desert island, sandy and inhospitable except for a cluster of palms in its centre (directly to the north) which afford some protection from the sun's heat. You can head into the sea to the south (if you have a boat) or you can go round the island to the west or east. To the west you notice a tall cone of rock, rising suddenly and incongruously from the sand.                                                                                                                           This is the western side of a small desert island, whose only vegetation is a group of palms to your east. The main feature of this section of the island is a strange cone of stone, rising suddenly from the sand and towering to a peak, to your southwest; this feature of the landscape - possibly formed long ago in an eruption of the great volcano to the south? - blocks your access to the sea from this area of the island. It can be climbed via some steps; or you can go round the island to north or south.     You have managed to enter the black tower; but its interior is not very interesting. Whoever designed it must not have meant it to be viewed from inside; the walls are bare, the floor only sand, and there are no stairs to the top, just a view up to the blue sky. The only thing to catch your attention is a tall pedestal, made from the same black stone as the tower itself, and clearly designed to hold something of value.                                                                                          You are on grey and uninteresting sea, south of mudflats where you could land if you chose. To the east is a strange mist and far off west-south-westerly you can see the peak of a volcano rising from the sea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                This is grey, listless and boring sea south of acres of mudflats - the best approximation you're likely to get to "dry" land round here. You are also close to the western side of some very peculiar mist, coming down thickly like a curtain to your east. You feel a peculiar dread of rowing into it, and though you realise this is probably magical, you cannot resist it.                                                                                                                                                You are rowing through fairly calm sea close to a sandy beach to your east. In all other directions the sea continues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          You are in the sea, close to the western coast of the Realm. Looking east you can see a sandy beach, and further a cliff with a narrow path winding up it. In all other directions the sea continues, though to the southeast are some black and dangerous-looking rocks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       You are on the open sea, some distance from any land, though to the southeast are dangerous and jagged rocks, and to the northwest and - much further off - to the southwest, you can see islands rising from the water.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        You're on the sea, fairly close to some nasty black rocks to the east, but otherwise far from any land.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Your boat is floating gently on calm water some distance from land, though you can see cliffs to your east and to the southwest there rises an island, steep and crowned with some kind of building. You think you can make out another island to the northwest and another much further south.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 You are rowing quite close to a tall white cliff - to your east - which blocks movement in that direction. Looking up you can see the grass on the edge of the cliff, and for a moment wish you were back safe on dry land. This could be achieved by rowing north - where there is a small cove where you could easily land - or south, where you could get into the harbour of the great city. Or you could head west and out to sea again.                                                                                   This part of the sea is just outside the western mouth of the harbour of the great city, and looking east you can see the great stone towers which guarded the harbour in days of yore, and further east the tall buildings - now shabby and decaying - which were once the houses of rich merchants and princes. Looking westwards you think you can see a tall island, coming to a point on which is set some kind of building; and far off to the southeast you can make out another island.                                 You are southwest of the coast of the Realm, where the land slopes down to meet the water; you can land here, or continue round the coast to the southeast, or head out to sea in any other direction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          You are on a part of the southwestern sea which makes you feel strangely dull and apathetic. The waves move sluggishly and hypnotically, faint shreds of mist swirl around you although there seems to be no wind to speak of; even the gulls seem distant and faint. You feel sleepy and realise that you had better muster your strength and get out of here....                                                                                                                                                              Mist is all around you and you cannot see more than a few yards in any direction. The mist muffles all sound and makes it difficult to judge direction; it makes you a little claustrophobic and more than a little apprehensive as you wonder if you will ever manage to get out of the mist....                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The mist here almost completely obscures your view; it is difficult to see your oars in the water, only a few feet away, let alone find your way to land. You are disorientated and you feel that if you push on into the mist, you are unlikely to find your way out again....                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 You are close to the south side of some dangerous rocks which are clearly not navigable even in your small boat; that way is blocked, though you can go in any other direction across the sea. To the southwest you can see an island, and some way to the east is the mainland.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Not far to your west you can see a fairly barren and sandy island, which is nonetheless safer than the waters of the open sea in all other directions. The mainland is now some distance to the east.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           You are on the open sea. Some distance to the west you can see an island, bare and inhospitable but better than the ocean; to the east is the mainland, not very far away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      You are quite close to the small island to your west, and you can see that the building surmounting its peak is built in the shape of a skull! Some evil temple, perhaps, or a castle of some grim lord? One thing is sure; the building looks deserted, and looks, too, as though it has been so for some time. You could head west towards the shore of the island, or east towards the mouth of the city harbour, not far away; or you could continue across the open sea to the north or the south.                         You are not far off the southeastern shores of a barren island, little more than a cone of rock rising out of the water but surmounted by an evil-looking building, carved in the shape of a skull facing eastwards. If you don't fancy investigating it more closely, you could head east towards the shore or southwest towards a larger island - a volcano.                                                                                                                                                                  This part of the sea is close to land in three directions; northeast is the mainland, northwest Skull Island (so called because of the building, carved like a skull, surmounting it) and southwest a second island, this one, you realise with some trepidation, an active volcano. If none of these choices satisfy you you can continue through the open sea in any other direction.                                                                                                                                         This is the far south of the sea, and quite some way now from any land, excepting the great volcanic island not far off to the west. To the south the ocean seems to stretch on for ever to the east is a thick bank of mysterious mist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        You are comprehensively lost in a bank of incredibly thick fog, so dense that you can hardly see the end of the boat. You have lost all sense of direction and realise the best thing to do would be to get out of this - quickly....                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           You are rowing into the blue emptiness of the northern sea, devoid of land. To your south you can see the coast of a small sandy island, not far away but gradually receding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   You are in the sea, off the northeastern side of a small desert island; not far up the beach to your south you can see a strange black tower which might be worth investigating. You can row round the island to the west or southeast, or head out to sea in any other direction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              You are some way northwest of the beaches at the edge of a small desert island, and can see quite clearly from here its main features; a strange tower made of some black stone which rises from the sand in the northern part of the island, a cluster of palms in its centre and further south a large outcropping of rock. West and north of you here is the open sea, with no islands in it as far as your vision reaches; south and east you can sail round the edges of the island.                                       You have rowed quite close to the western side of a small desert island, but cannot land by going east as a tall outcropping of rock blocks off all the western and southwestern side of the island from the sea. You could get onto the north beaches of the island by going northeast, though, or you could go north or south round the island or west into the open sea.                                                                                                                                                     You are in calm waters, close to the southwestern side of a small island; access to its shores is blocked off by a large rock formation which encircles the whole of the island's western and southwestern edge. You can row round the island to the east or the north, or head out into the western ocean or southwards towards another island not far away.                                                                                                                                                                   You're a little way south of a gently sloping sandy beach, the southern part of a small desert island. Looking north you can see a cluster of palms in the island's centre, and looming over them a dark tower, built of gleaming black stone; while to the northwest is a natural outcropping of stone which blocks the way to the western parts of the island from the sea.                                                                                                                                                   Northwest of here you can get onto the southern beaches of a small desert island. In all other directions is sea; you can see no end to it to the west, though to the east you can make out white cliffs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       West of you are the eastern beaches of a small desert island, with a cluster of palms at the centre, a stone tower to the north and a large outcropping of rock to the south. East is the open sea, and further the white cliffs that mark the beginning of dry land; north and south you can row round the island.                                                                                                                                                                                                             You are drifting in calm, shallow and sunlit waters not far from the southern beaches of a desert island. The sun's warmth makes you relaxed and dreamy; you feel you don't want to row any more, that you will just let the ocean carry you off to distant lands.... Of course, this is a ridiculous idea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     All around is water, though to the north and further south you can see the shores of islands, and some way to the east is the mainland itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  You are sailing over a vast expanse of gleaming and sunlit sea, close to two islands to the north and south, but some way away from the mainland to the east. Further west the ocean continues as far as the eye can see, unpunctuated by islands until the western horizon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    You are sailing into the vast and uncharted western ocean; facing east, you can see small islands and - much further - the white cliffs of the mainland, all gradually receding as you head into the West.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      You are rowing slowly and steadily into the emptiness of the seas to the far south of the Realm. But though you try your hardest, you can't help feeling that you're not getting anywhere. Volcano Island is still firmly to your west, and a strange bank of thick fog to the northeast; while the blue waters of the more northerly seas do not seem to be receding at all...                                                                                                                                                 You are sailing the far western seas, west of Skull Island (named for the building on its top shaped like an evil skull facing east) and north of Volcano Island - the reason for this name being obvious when you see the plume of smoke that rises from its peak. Some distance to the north you can see a third island. West there is no land and the sea stretches on unbroken to the horizon.                                                                                                                              You are off the northwestern shores of Skull Island, a bleak, barren and stony place with no vegetation whose only interesting feature is the skull-shaped edifice on its peak (the island slopes steeply upwards from the sea). You may land here if you choose; round the island to the south the rocks are too steep to get onto land.                                                                                                                                                                                       You are close to the northeast shores of Skull Island and may land here if you choose; round the island to the south the rocks are too steep to climb, but here the stony peak slopes down to the waterline and the rocks - though still steep - are negotiable. You could also row round the island to the west or head out into the sea in other directions. To the east you can just make out the mainland and the harbour of the great city.                                                                                You are southeast of the steep cliffs which drop almost vertically from the peak of Skull Island all along its south shores, making access to the skull-shaped building on its top impossible from the south side. You could of course row north or west round the island in search of a better landing area, or head southwards towards an even taller island, almost a mountain, rising out of the water in this direction; from whose peak there trails a faint plume of smoke.                                              This area of the sea is close to the tall cliffs which block off access to Skull Island's southern side - though landing on the island is possible by going round it to the north or the east. You are also very close to a second island - this is the point where Skull Island and Volcano island come very close together, and its shores are to the southwest. If you don't fancy that the seas continue in any other direction....                                                                                         You are passing through the game's far western seas, close to both Skull Island (some way to the west) and Volcano Island to the south and southwest. Further west the seas are empty and stretch on to the furthest horizon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   You are between the shores of Volcano Island (to the south and west) and Skull Island to the north - though looking in that direction it seems as though you wouldn't be able to land there from the south, because of the high cliffs on that side of the island. East-north-easterly is the mainland, some distance away across the water.                                                                                                                                                                                    You are in shallow waters north of the lowest slopes of the volcano, rising out of the sea to your south. It should be possible to land and climb it. You can sail round the mountain to the west and southeast; heading west or north will take you away from it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              You're in the sea on the eastern side of the volcano, where the mountainside is at its least steep and it should be possible to climb the slopes. You might land there, head round the volcano to the north or southwest, or head off into the eastern sea; the way south and southeast is blocked by lava thrown off by the volcano, creating a treacherous area of jagged rocks which it would be folly to try to navigate.                                                                                                   You have rowed round to the southeast side of the volcano, and can look up its steep slopes to the lip of the fuming crater at the top. You could probably land here, as the slopes to the northwest are comparatively shallow; or you could row round the volcano to the north or west. All ways south and east are blocked by lava which, thrown out by countless eruptions over the years, has formed a barrier of jagged and dangerous rocks which are completely un-navigable.                                             This is the sea southwest of the volcano. It also seems as if this is the furthest southwest you can come, for all around to the south, west and southwest is a ring of solidified lava - jagged and dangerous rocks - which block completely any rowing in that direction. Neither can you ascend the slopes of the volcano; they are too steep here, falling in great crags and chasms almost vertically from the peak. So you must go round the mountain either to north or west.                                            You are in the sea off the northwestern side of the volcano. You cannot land on it here, as the slopes to the southeast are much too steep; nor can you go north or west, because the lava thrown off by the volcano forms a jagged and dangerous barrier of stone in those directions. But you can row round the mountain to the east and south, or head away from it to the northeast.                                                                                                                                        You have come to the centre of the palm grove and are standing beneath a large and tall palm. At first you are only interested in this tree for the shelter it gives from the burning sun; but as you rest beneath it you notice strange signs and runes carved deep into the bark. You wonder if something might have been hidden here....                                                                                                                                                                                     You're on the east side of a small grove of palms. Further east you can see the beach of this island.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           This is the north side of a little cluster of palms in the centre of a desert island. Further north you can see a beach and a somewhat incongruous tower (made from black stone) which rises from it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The west side of a palm grove, close to a large outcropping of rock which dominates the western side of the island and is climbable further west and southwest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 You are on the south side of a palm grove in the centre of a small desert island. Looking southwards you can see the sea washing up a warm sandy beach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         You are near the bottom of some steps which climb up the large rock outcropping which dominates the south-west side of the desert island. The steps, carved from the tough rock with obviously a great deal of effort, continue up the slope without wind or twist, and lead downwards to the sand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             You are on a flight of steps carved from a natural rock outcrop which lead both up and down from here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          You're near the top of a flight of steps which were made to facilitate the climbing of this large rock outcropping, the dominant feature of the south side of this desert island. Further up is a ledge; below you can look down to the sand of the beach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      You are on a narrow ledge in the rock at the top of a short flight of steps leading up a strange rocky outcrop on the southwest side of a desert island. The steps end here, and though the rock continues it is too steep to climb any further. However there is another exit from this location, in the form of a cave mouth - you can't tell from here whether the cave is natural or not - which allows you to go south into the rock itself.                                                                               This small cave is not natural, but man-made, and judging from the precautions the makers took to prevent anyone getting in, it was once used as a treasure store - perhaps by pirates. However little of the vast store of treasure that was once kept here now remains. There is just one exit, to the north.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 You are on the lower northwest slopes of Skull Island. South the steep rocks rise towards the peak, and east they continue at the same level. Those to the southwest look far too dangerous to climb; it looks as though a rockslide has carried away much of the mountainside. North, west and northeast is the sea.                                                                                                                                                                                                           The lower northeast slopes of Skull Island, scrambling among jagged rocks, close to the sea to the north, east and northwest. To the south a rockslide has made the rocks impassable in that direction; however you can walk round the island, west, or climb further up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       You are standing on the northwest side of the peak of Skull Island, close to the temple - built in the shape of a skull - that gives it its name. The skull faces east, and you could walk round the rim in that direction to get to the entrance, or round to the west to get to the south side of the building. Or you could jump down from this flattened surface to the scree slopes of the island below.                                                                                                                   You are edging with extreme care round the south side of the Skull Temple. The southern half of Skull Island slid into the sea long ago, taking most of the path round the southern side with it, with the result that you are just inches away from a nauseating drop down to the sea and the rocks below. You had better move... you can go either east or west round the temple, with the eastern route taking you to the front of the temple and its entrance.                                                              These are the upper slopes of Skull Island, and the climbing here is hard going, as the slope is almost perpendicular and the rocks are a mass of small pebbles and scree which slip away from you as you try to rest your weight on them. Looking further up does not encourage you either, as you can see now clearly the great building, shaped like a skull, which is set on the summit of the island and gives it its name. It is not a cheery sight.                                                                      You are clutching a spur of rock which makes a good handhold to stop you sliding to your death, on the uppermost and steepest slopes of the northeastern side of Skull Island. You are quite close here to Skull Temple, the great building in the shape of a malevolent eastward-gazing skull that tops the peak of the island; a bit of climbing would bring you up in front of it and close to its entrance. Or you could head downwards towards the sea.                                                                    You are on a narrow shelf of rock on the top of Skull Island, which you can walk round to the north and south. You are also standing before a huge and hideous temple, built in the shape of a malevolent skull, whose entrance - between two of its teeth - is close by to the west. Looking up at the bleached white stone - a perfect representation of bone - and the glaring eye sockets, you are not at all sure whether you want to go in....                                                                            You are in the Skull Temple, a vast and eerie place whose main feature is a mighty throne (with steps leading up to it) set in the very centre of the hall.  Apart from this the place is empty. It is also uncomfortable, echoing, and very cold, and you feel no desire to stay here - and a positive desire to be gone....                                                                                                                                                                                                   You are sitting on the throne in the middle of Skull Temple. For a moment as you look around you can see this place as it must once have been; beautiful tapestries and cloth of gold deck the walls, brilliant lights shine from the roof and drive away the darkness, trumpets sound proudly from behind the throne and a crowd prostrate themselves in adulation on the rich carpeting before you. Then the vision fades, and you are looking at a bare and chilly hall once more. Steps lead down from the throne.          You're on the lowest southeast slopes of the volcano, close to the sea. You can ascend or walk round it to the north. The way west is too steep and too dangerous to attempt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   This is the lowest northeastern slope of the volcano, close to the sea. You can walk round the mountain to the south or climb the steep slopes; to the west the rocks are steep and dangerous, and you would not be able to climb them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         About halfway up the volcano, and it now becomes a struggle to avoid being burnt by rivers of semi-molten lava which wind their way sluggishly down the slope of the mountain. Further up the going is harder still, though below it is safer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  You rest, fighting for breath, about halfway up the southeast slopes of the volcano. The heat here is far worse than it is down below, though not as bad as it is further up; and you need time to recover. Don't wait too long, though - the volcano may start erupting again any minute....                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   You are now close to the top of the volcano and the lava-filled crater, and are finding it difficult to avoid the slowly solidifying streams of lava - the volcano was erupting only a few minutes before, and this is only a brief respite...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  You are near the top of the volcano and the rim of the crater. The heat from above is intense but bearable, though you still feel an urge to return downwards towards the sea. You realise with trepidation that if the volcano were to erupt you would be frazzled to a crisp in seconds....                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   You are on the very rim of the volcano crater, from which, a few moments ago, were spewing huge chunks of lava and molten rock and poisonous gases. The heat is still intense from the crater to the west, but the lava has receded, bubbling and spitting perhaps twenty feet down the shaft of the volcano. You could even venture westward into the crater.... or you could, of course, return extremely quickly down the volcano towards the sea and safety.                                                                You are about six feet below the rim of the volcano - but from the inside. You are in fact in the very crater of the volcano, and the heat is so intense that you imagine yourself to be burning away. You realise with a shudder that if the volcano were to start to erupt once more you would be - and you would, too, if you fell into the pool of molten rock not far below you. You can descend still further, or return upwards to the crater's edge.                                                                    You have come the closest to the pool of lava it is possible to come, and you have to cover your face to shield it from the heat blasting upwards from the bubbling, spitting, red-hot glowing pool of molten rock just ten feet below you - hotter than a furnace, hot enough to melt metal - certainly hot enough to frazzle flesh and bone to white-hot cinders, were you to lose your balance and fall... To the west and east, you notice with amazement, are two small tunnels; or you can return up towards safety.      This tunnel, obviously kept open by powerful magical forces (for otherwise it would long ago have been sealed up by the lava from the volcano to the west) leads eastwards into the rock and darkness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          This east-west tunnel is lit dimly by a red and flickering glow from the west. To the east the darkness is complete.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Your light flickers casting shadows round this small and clearly man-made cavern. At some time men must have decided that this was the perfect place to hide treasure; for who would think of looking in the mouth of an active volcano? Only an idiot like you, evidently.... The passage to the exit, protected from the lava by many spells, leads west from here towards the crater.                                                                                                                                        This narrow and low-ceilinged east-west tunnel connects to the wall of the volcano crater to the east. It is clearly protected by magical power, as otherwise it would have been blocked up long ago by the lava. Westward it leads into darkness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              An east-west tunnel, lit from the east by a red flickering glow that is not daylight but the light coming from molten rock, leading into darkness to the west.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  This is a man-made, not a natural cavern; you can see that much in your dim light as you look around. The marks of pick and hammer are still on the roughly hewn walls, untouched by time or the lava. Powerful magic must have gone into the protection of this area from the force of the volcano; and much labour, too, in creating the tunnels and the cave. It seems a bit pointless, really, though you suppose that an active volcano is a reasonably good place to hide treasure....                                    You are in the great nonagonal entrance hall to Hamlet's Caves. In the southeastern wall - or the wall most nearly southeast - is the small stone door that gives entrance to the Caves. To the northwest and west are other doors, which are both wider and lower, so that you will have to duck under them. They have certainly not been made for humans to pass through...                                                                                                                                                   You are in a perfectly octagonal room, with four of the curious low, wide doors which characterise this part of the cave complex, to the west, north, east and northeast. However, the contents of the room are far more diverting than its exits... in the very centre is an octagonal well of white marble with stone steps leading down into it. In it swirls liquid - or possibly vapour - of many colours, which shift and billow in curious, transient patterns. It moves almost as if it were alive...                   You are in a bare cold cave, irregular but roughly heptagonal in its geometry. There are doorways west, northwest, southwest and southeast. Around the northwestern door a little dark water washes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            You are in a hexagonal cave, elegant in the simplicity of its design... the finer points of its architecture are lost on you, however, as you are knee-deep in black, icy water and shivering uncontrollably. The mandatory wide, low doors are west, southwest and southeast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  You are in the pentagonal cave, with doorways east, north, south and northeast, with dark water washing about the northeastern exit. There is a curious odour here and looking around, you see many tracks of some great beast leading in all directions, also scattered bones and human debris. Evidently this in the den of some creature of the caves, and involuntarily you find yourself glancing nervously about, anticipating its return.                                                                                You are in a small square stone room, with doors east, west and south. A little dark water laps about the eastern doorway.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      You are in a poky little triangular cave with low wide doorways south and east; east is a cave but to the south a low tunnel down which you will probably have to crawl.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        You are crawling down a long low north - south tunnel. The roof is cracked and fissured and in places you can see, high above, daylight and blue sky.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           You are in a circular cavern - not merely rounded, but mathematically perfect, the walls smooth as glass and polished as a mirror - and therefore as reflective; you wander for a while  before finding your bearings. When you are recovered, you see that there are small doorways both north and east, and a small hatch in the floor.                                                                                                                                                                                       You have come to the north end of a north - south tunnel. There is no way on from here; you must go back southwards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            You are in the lower octagonal room. This is a damp dank cave with green slime oozing down the walls, and the stony floor lined with mosses and unpleasant fungal growths which give off a foul and putrid stench. There are caves north and west, a passage to the northeast, and to the south a tunnel which stretches on as far as the eye can see.                                                                                                                                                                          You are in the lower circular room. An iron ladder leads up to a hatch in the high ceiling of the cave. There is a doorway to your east, apart from that the cave is bare.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      You are in the lower pentagonal room. This was once used as a treasure chamber but it has long ago been looted by adventurers, and they have left little of use or value. The only door is to the south.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        You are in a narrow passage connecting two caves, one to the southwest and one to the northeast. Water drips from the ceiling, and stagnant water forms deep puddles on the floor. The walls of the tunnel are covered in a nasty green ooze, and the whole revolting place stinks like a sanctuary for alcoholic trolls.                                                                                                                                                                                                       You are in a nasty, dirty, smelly, wet cave, knee-deep in fungus-pulp and muddy water; every now and then this slimy mixture bubbles and ripples. Tunnels lead east and southwest; they look fairly awful too, really.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          You are in a grotty damp little tunnel between two caves. Green slime oozes on the walls, and your feet sink deep into moss. A curious weed grows on the roof, hanging down like green hair.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    You are in a rough-hewn cave. A tunnel leads off to the west and above an aperture gapes in the ceiling, but the metal ladder has been broken off short and cast aside to rust - as it will quickly in these damp caves. Whoever lives in the rooms above obviously wants privacy, and someone must dwell there, for you can see above the red flicker of torchlight.                                                                                                                                                           You are in a long tunnel leading off southwards as far as the eye can see...

You are in a long tunnel leading off southwards as far as the eye can see...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    You are in a long tunnel leading off southwards as far as the eye can see...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    You are near the southern end of the long tunnel. South you can see a great arched doorway, and beyond, a hideous red light which casts monstrous shadows back into the northern darkness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      You are at the bottom of a deep chasm, on the north bank of a river of molten rock, which flows from the west to the east and down into darkened caves. To your north is a steep, sheer cliff face; set in this is an arched doorway, beyond that a dark tunnel; and you cower back there from the heat. The narrow black shore between cliff and lava curves around cliff corners southeast and northwest.                                                                                                                     You are in a large empty cave. A tunnel leads west. There is a crevice in the ceiling, but it is much too high to reach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        You are edging along the narrow black stony shore sloping northwest between the lava river and the cliff face. Here it bends west and east around cliff corners.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                You are on the narrow east - west shore of the lava river. It curves around the cliff northwest and to the east the shore continues beyond the mouth of the caves. You will need no light if you enter, for the caverns are illuminated by the red glow of the lava river as far east as you can see...                                                                                                                                                                                                                         You are in the entrance to the lava caves, upon the shore of the lava river itself. To the west is daylight, to the east only the dim red light of the lava river as it flows into darkness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    You are in the lava caves, on the shore of the lava river. To the north is a narrow opening in the rock, east and west the shore continues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Here the shore comes to its eastern end, as the lava river narrows and diverges here, curving northwards across your path. You must turn back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  You are on the broad western bank of the lava river, in a kind of tunnel including both river and shore. To your east a slender and flimsy bridge spans the flood, and passes into dark caves beyond. To the northwest a tunnel leads off into darkness and to the north this shore is cracked by many narrow chasms, though you might be able to cross. You could also head out of the caves, to the south.                                                                                                                    You are on the bridge across the lava river. West is the bank and east are dark caves. You look over the flimsy rail only for a brief moment, and then pull back in alarm at your danger. The whole bridge reeks of magic, necessary no doubt to keep the whole unsafe contraption from charring from the heat or melting like snow.                                                                                                                                                                                            You are in the Balrog's Cave, an unpleasant place filled with horrible red light from an unseen source. It flickers continually, and you jump back from every shadow. The floor is littered with the remains of those who came before you - scorched bones and charred flesh.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Here the shore peters out against the northern cliff. You will have to return southeast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        You are standing on cracked and broken land. North, the ground gapes wide across the shore, and you can only go back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           You are in a narrow northwest - southeast tunnel. Another leads off north into darkness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        You are at the north end of a narrow tunnel. You have come to a small stone doorway.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            You are at the northwest end of a narrow tunnel. You have come to a small stone doorway.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        You are in the West Chamber, a splendid natural cavern of great size and beauty, whose many stalactites and stalagmites, illuminated by your light, gleam in sparkling hues of orange, gold and brown as you wander entranced about the Cave. A narrow - man-made - tunnel leads off east and a stone doorway is to the south.                                                                                                                                                                                                  You are in a narrow tunnel connecting the East Chamber to the West Chamber, where a second tunnel, large and rounded, joins it from the northwest. It is clear that some great beast has made its lair here, probably to catch unwary travellers who pass through the junction...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               You are in the East Chamber, a magnificent natural cavern of grand proportions. Here a tiny, ice - cold stream flows through the caves, presumably formed by melting snow from the mountains above. It enters via a small hole near the top and forms many clear pools in the rocks of the caves before flowing out of a tiny fissure. A narrow tunnel leads off west and there is a stone doorway to the south.                                                                                                                You are in a circular tunnel northwest - southeast between two caves. Another, similar tunnel branches off northeast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           You are in a small grey cavern with a smelly, muddy floor which bubbles intermittently. In the very centre, a small and sulphurous geyser hisses and whistles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  You are in a circular tunnel which goes southwest at one end and forks north and east at the other.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             You are in a small north - south circular tunnel which bends southwest at one end and continues north at the other.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             You are in a narrow circular east - west tunnel which bends southwest at one end and northeast at the other.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    You are in a circular tunnel which goes west at one end and forks north and east at the other.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  You are in a little north - south tunnel which bends southwest at one end and has a few steps down into a low dark cave at the other. From this direction you seem to hear the faint plashing of water.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         You are in a low cave half - filled with clear, pure water, with small fish darting about in it. It is numbingly cold. Southwards and out are stone steps leading up and out into dark tunnels, and some few inches above the water's surface is a ladder leading up into a crevice in the rock above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          You are in a small cave; a metal ladder leads into a larger one below, where water washes. A small tunnel leads east to a T - junction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         You are at a T - junction. Tunnels lead west, north and south.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  You are in the Gateway Cave. Two stone statues representing mythical figures flank a bronze gateway set in the north wall. The cave walls have been smoothed and ornamented, and the roof has been glazed and painted. The only other exit is south, down a small tunnel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       You are in a small cave above a much larger one. You could drop down through a crevice in the floor, but as there is no ladder, you might not be able to climb back up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         You are crossing the great underground lake, and have reached its centre, equidistant here from the western and eastern banks. Pausing briefly, you look about you and are awed by the splendid rock formations which rise in grotesque splendour from the water and the equally magnificent stalactites that hang from the high roof of the cavern - all illuminated in bright colours by your light and mirrored in the cool still waters of the lake.                                                                        These are the eastern waters of the underground lake: the water ends, abruptly, further east and northeast, at a rock shelf where you may land. The lake itself continues westward into the unfathomable dark. On the rocky bank nearest to you - to the east - a small stream has cut a groove, and this stream, splashing into the waters of the underground pool, would seem to be its source - though from this angle you are unable to tell where the stream itself comes from.                                            This is the northern part of the eastern bank of a great underground lake, whose waters, black and chill, stretch on to the west, punctuated only by the grotesque forms of stalagmites - reaching out of the pool to the rocky ceiling of the cavern, far above. The bank itself is bare rock, and continues to the south, whence you hear the sound of running water. East and north tunnels lead into the rock: the eastern tunnel is worn, as with many feet.                                                               You are now on the southern part of the east bank of the underground lake; and it is a gloomy and barren place, bare rock underfoot and dark cold still waters stretching west as far as eye can see or light show. A thin stream - bitter and chill - flows from a great crack in the roof and across the bank westwards to splash into the lake, the only break in the awesome silence. Eastwards a narrow and low tunnel has been delved into the rock; the bank continues north.                                            You are in a very low crawl, leading eastwards. This, it seems, is also the path of an underground stream; it flows about your hands and knees as you crawl and its bitter chill takes your breath away. Just here, though, it passes through a great crack in the floor to flow into what seems to be a very large and spacious chamber. You could descend, though you might not be able to get back up again, or you could continue east.                                                                                     You're negotiating a very low east-west crawl along the course of a chilly underground stream. At times the ceiling is so low that you must dip your face in the near - freezing water to continue. The stream divides here; one branch flows westward while a second passes down an even smaller crack to the north which you might just be able to squeeze into.                                                                                                                                                              You are passing along a narrow east-west crawl - extremely claustrophobic - which has been formed by the action of water upon rock - the water being the chilly underground stream that flows about your hands and knees as you crawl. The crawl continues westwards, in the same direction as the stream is flowing, while to the east you may enter a large room.                                                                                                                                                             This large and well-constructed room was clearly once part of the extensive mine workings that form the basis for these caverns; maybe even a control centre of some importance. The reason for its abandoned state is clear, though: a torrent of water pours from a large round hole in the roof, and the room is almost a foot deep in ice-cold water, which drains through a narrow crack in the western wall. The other exit is up though the hole, via a rusty metal ladder.                                              This is the lower part of a very rusty iron ladder in a smooth - walled rock shaft. The reason for the rust is apparent; a torrent of water falls from some source higher up the shaft, drenching you, and even making it difficult to retain your grip on the ladder, such is its force. The shaft continues above, while below the ladder leads into a wide chamber.                                                                                                                                                          You're on the upper part of a rusty metal ladder in a rock shaft. A torrent of water cascades down onto you as you cling to the ladder; the water's source cannot be seen, but if you were to go up you might find it, as you enter a large chamber in that direction. Downwards the shaft and the ladder continue.                                                                                                                                                                                                             Once you are able to look around you, you can see that this was once a chamber of some importance. The walls are lined with controls, all incomprehensible to you, and all now rusted and useless because of the stream of water which plays over them (and you!) from a crack in the ceiling - perhaps the Lake above has broken through the rock here? The only thing to have survived is a bell-rope hanging from the roof; the only exit down via a metal ladder.                                                           A narrow and low east-west tunnel in the rock. West it opens out into what seems to be a huge cavern, while east it goes deeper still.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          You're walking down a very low tunnel - clearly not designed for humans - which runs east and west through the rock. East it ends at a low stone arch, and through this you can just about make out a small chamber or anteroom of some kind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   This chamber looks as though it was once used for storing the many materials and treasures used and found in the Kobold mines. However, since the fall of the Kings and the destruction of much of the Realm the mine workings have gone downhill and much has been lost or abandoned. As a result this room now stands empty and bare. You can pass through low stone arches into narrow tunnels to north, west and east.                                                                                                      This is a low-ceilinged east-west tunnel, part of the Kobold mines. To the west it enters a small chamber of some kind, while to the east it seems to join other tunnels to form a junction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    You're now at a junction, where a wide but low east-west tunnel joins another passage running southwards. The southern tunnel looks as though it ends at a door a few yards down, but you can't be sure...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      You've come to the end of a tunnel from the west. This tunnel was clearly once intended to be a major part of the mine workings: it is wide and well constructed. But for some unknown reason the builders have stopped here; only the marks of pickaxe and shovel on the eastern rockface are left as testimony to their endeavour.                                                                                                                                                                                            You are in a short north-south passage, which joins others to form a T - junction to the north and ends at a stout wooden door, studded with metal, a few yards south of here. There is nothing remarkable about this passage, other than its surprising lack of height - you have to stoop to move along it, and you guess that it was not designed for humans to travel.                                                                                                                                                      This room is quite clearly a prison cell. It is barren and bare, with only a meagre pallet of straw lying on the cold flagstones of the floor, and the door - to the north - is of sturdy wood studded with metal. A grille, set perhaps twenty feet up - far too high for you to be able to reach it - allows some uninspiring daylight onto the scene. Not a very nice place at all, on the whole...                                                                                                                          A short and well-worn passage, north-south, joining a small chamber to the south with a much larger one to the north. There's nothing very interesting about this place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        This is a wide and well-used tunnel, leading east and west. West it opens into somewhere much larger - it looks like quite a big cave, with a large body of water in it - and east it continues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                You're in an east-west tunnel, wide and well used though with a very low ceiling which forces you to stoop. Eastward it enters a large and seemingly spacious cavern: you can't make out any details of it though. West the tunnel continues, and you think you hear the sound of running water in this direction.                                                                                                                                                                                                              This appears to be one of the few areas left in the caverns where mining still goes on. Rubble lines the walls on all sides (though you can pass through wide exits to south, west and east) and the marks of pickaxes are on the walls. Footprints - much too small to be human - are plainly visible in the dust, especially around the eastern exit. But there doesn't appear to be any work going on here at the moment - nor have the kobolds left any gems lying around...                                                This is a small passage, leading from the east to the west, and joining a very large chamber to the west to a much smaller one to the east. The floor of the tunnel is thick with stone dust, and in the dust footprints can clearly be seen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   This is a storeroom, used for holding valuable treasures. In happier days this area would not have been open to vagabonds like you, but kept securely locked. However somebody - not long ago - has forced the great wooden door, which now hangs cracked and broken on its hinges. Gone are the luxurious furnishings which once adorned the chamber, and gone, too, are most of the treasures - gemstones and precious metals - it would once have contained...                                                               You're in a dark and narrow north-south passage, hewn from glittering black rock which reflects your light dimly from its smooth surfaces. This passage seems to have been made with greater care than many of the rude and roughly - hewn tunnels of the caves, and you wonder what might lie along it... To the south it enters a great natural cavern, and you hear the sound of water in this direction, but its northerly end is veiled in darkness.                                                                       You have entered an ancient and eerie chamber, hewn in its entirety from the glittering black rock of the caves. From the floor rises a stone column, smooth, and fifteen feet high - carved of the same stone as, and in one piece with the floor. Surmounting this is a grinning skull of the same stone, five times man size, facing westerly. North, south and east are high archways, leading into darkness.                                                                                                               This is an antechamber to the Skull Shrine through the western portal. A similar idol stands here, but of less size, and with many strange runes graven on its column. Before it, and occupying most of the room, is a great pit, circular in shape and sheer of side. Though you peer into the depths, its blackness is impenetrable. At the base of the pillar, you notice, a skeletal hand has been engraved, its bony finger pointing down; what this means, you cannot say.                                                You're in a north-south tunnel, narrow but high, and made entirely of a curious gleaming black stone, carved into many mysterious figures and runes on the wall. Further south the tunnel leads into a large chamber, but the darkness here is such that you can't tell what might lie within. Northwards the floor of the tunnel has fallen in, creating a chasm which is crossed by a makeshift and rickety wooden bridge.                                                                                                    You are on a makeshift bridge of wood crossing a chasm which has opened in the floor of a north-south passage. The bridge was not designed to take your weight, and creaks ominously as you cross it: below you can dimly see movement, and hear the rushing of water. You might - if you dared - drop down into the waters below, but would certainly not be able to get back up.                                                                                                                                              This is a north-south tunnel hewn from black stone. Northwards it joins other passages to form a junction, while south the floor has collapsed into what seems to be a sewer below - forming a chasm, crossed by an unsafe - looking wooden bridge; clearly the work of the Kobolds and not of the builders of these tunnels.                                                                                                                                                                                                   This is a 4-way junction, with passages leading north, south, east and west. In all directions the walls are of polished black stone and the tunnels lead into impenetrable blackness - except for the eastern one, from which you think you can see a faint glimmer of light.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  You're in a narrow dark north-south passage, which meets a junction southwards and leads into a largish chamber further north.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  This room is built in the shape of an octagon, mathematically flawless, hewn from black rock in the heart of a mountain. A passage leads south, but the feature which really catches your eye is an octagonal well in the centre of the room, filled with a vortex of colours which defy description and clearly magical. Steps lead down to it...                                                                                                                                                                              This is an east-west passage, made from dark rock intricately carved, joining a junction westwards and leading into a large room to the east. From this direction there shines a weird light...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 You have entered a large room, with exits east and west. In its centre glows a pillar of light, reaching from the floor to the ceiling, made of  bright ribbons of colour, and these strange colours are writhing and changing as you watch, their sickly hues weaving a pattern that is both hideous and yet strangely attractive... You cannot tear your eyes away from the hypnotic shapes, and despite your efforts to master yourself you find yourself moving slowly towards the pillar...                                This small round chamber is completely bare, acting as an anteroom to the Room of Writhing Patterns to the west (through the only exit). You might find something here to act as a reward for having negotiated the cave: on the other hand, you might not...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   This is an incredibly cramped north-south crawl, almost impossible to negotiate in places, and half-filled with freezing water, flowing swiftly north. Southwards this crawl joins another, still narrow and cramped but seeming much larger after the one you are in at the moment; northwards it continues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   You're crawling along the path (leading north-south) of an underground stream, flowing northwards, which long ago forced a path between the rocks here and has since widened the crack to a point where you can just fit down it. Even so, it is difficult to pass along it, especially as the stream is ice-cold. Northwards the stream - and the crawl - join a wider tunnel of some kind; from this direction there comes a noxious smell.                                                                                   You are standing in cold, filthy and stinking water, up to your neck and flowing swiftly westwards. This east-west tunnel in fact appears to be the main sewer of the caves. Directly above you - but some twelve feet up - is a wooden bridge, crossing a great chasm in the ceiling of the tunnel where the floor of the tunnel above has collapsed. There is no way up to the bridge, though, and as the passage slopes down to the west the water would cover your head if you tried to go that way; so you must go east.   You are up to your chest in cold and filthy water, flowing quickly west through this wide east-west tunnel. Looking around at the many pipes which empty into the water - some dripping foul-smelling liquids - you realise with disgust that this must be the main sewer and waste outfall of the mines. You can't leave this tunnel here, though, except possibly through a great crack in the southern wall, from which cold but clean water runs into the main stream.                                                      You are waist-high in cold, filthy water which flows westwards through an east-west tunnel. The tunnel is sloping downwards to the west - which accounts for the swift running of the stream - and you surmise that going east would take you into shallower water.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             You're standing in a wide east-west tunnel, knee-high in foul and chilly water, which flows in through a grate in the eastern wall and can't be followed in that direction, and leaves westwards. There is also a bore-hole in the southern wall - you might be able to fit into it - and a deep crack has opened in the wall to the north.                                                                                                                                                                                     This is a very narrow north-south bore-hole, only negotiable by a flat crawl. From the south there wafts a foul smell, while to the north you can hear water running.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           You have entered the nest of a giant rat, stinking and filled with little other than bones, refuse and the filth of generations. A narrow bore-hole, leading north, is the only exit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           You've squeezed into a narrow crack in the rock. You can go south into a sewer or try to get further north into the crack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      This is an extremely tight place, wedged firmly between massive rocks to the east and west. You can retreat south - where the crack is marginally wider - or try to squeeze through the rocks to the north into a huge cave. From this direction you imagine you can hear a deep rumbling sound, something like a huge creature snoring...                                                                                                                                                                                      You are now in a great natural cavern, illuminated by your light in dancing shadows which flicker and chase one another across the gnarled and veined marble of the walls. From all around, echoing across the cavern, you hear a deep rumbling sound. You look around for its source...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        You are in a small oblong room cut out of the living rock, which in less austere days was used as a cellar, but which now is almost empty. A short passage leads east. In one corner is a huge tun of wine, firmly fixed to the wall and supported on a hefty tripod. Although the tap on it looks to have rusted solid in the damp air, you might be able to fill a cup from it if you tried.                                                                                                                                  You are in a chill natural cave beneath Hamlet's Castle, on the north bank of a small pool. A short passage leads west into a smaller room. There is a wooden trapdoor in the ceiling, which you can just reach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                You are in the ice pool between the north and south bank and between the east and west cave walls. Thin sheets and slivers of ice float silently around you on the ink black chill water and strange and slimy creatures stare from the quiet depths.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           You are on the southern shore of the ice pool, at the southern end of the vast cavern which contains it, on a narrow bar of land. There is no passage south from here, so you will have to re-cross the pool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   You are in the northern part of the northeast tower base. High above is a narrow gantry, and high above that is some massive mechanical device. A high narrow window looks out over lands to the north.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         You are in the southern part of the northeast tower base. Above you is a narrow gantry, and still higher is a large, complex machine, full of cogs and gears and weights. The room in itself is uninteresting, with bare stone walls and a floor of hard earth; and it continues to the north.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  You are in a narrow east - west passage sloping downwards to the east. In the north wall is the postern gate, where the lord of the castle could escape in time of siege.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       You are in what you take to be the dining room by the wooden tables which run almost its whole length. It is a queer shape, like an obese L, and with poor light, for though there are windows in the east wall, they face only onto a shadowy enclave between the cliff and the northeast tower. There is a doorway to the south into the kitchens and another west into a small chamber.                                                                                                                                      You are on a fairly typical Elizabethan stage, with all standard fittings. At the back of the stage, to the east, is a narrow passage, presumably for the actors to make their exits and their entrances. To the south is an area intended to seat the audience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                You are in the auditorium of a small theatre. To the south is a doorway to a small chamber; to the north you can climb down onto the stage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     You are in a small chilly chamber north of the central courtyard, from which a cold wind blows. To the east is the dining room, and west is a more comfortably furnished room.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  You are in a pleasant chamber, with tapestry hung walls, and - luxury of luxuries - a carpet! Exits are north, east and west.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   You are in a large, well furnished chamber, perhaps used for entertaining guests. There are doorways south, east and west; north a narrow high window looks out over the land.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  You are in a curious little room, the result of the architectural oddities caused where the castle meets the cliff. Although north, west and eastern walls are ordinary enough, the southern wall is more of a southwestern wall and part of the living rock, the join between cliff and castle carefully mortared over. West is a door to the outside, east a doorway to a larger chamber than this.                                                                                                                           You are in a little outdoor enclave between the cliff and the castle, which is used as a graveyard, with high grass growing between the tombstones - and in one place a freshly dug grave. To the east is the main castle and north the entrance to a tower.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    You are at the bottom of a newly-dug grave - fortunately as yet tenantless. Though it is deep and the sides have been smoothed off with a spade, you could maybe scramble out at one of the corners.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            You are at the bottom of the northwest tower. Hamlet is obviously not too concerned about who shares his castle with him, for the tower has become a home to birds, and been allowed to crumble and erode. The stairs, certainly, are unclimbable beyond the first few steps, the walls are moss-grown, the window-bars rusty. The only exit is to the south, into the open air.                                                                                                                                                You are in a room more than half a natural cavern, a result of the castle's weird architecture. There are doors to north and east, and to the south is a bronze gateway flanked by two mythical figures. The walls are smoothed and ornamented, the ceiling glazed and painted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 You are in the cobbled central courtyard, quite open to the elements. In the centre is a small sundial upon a column. There are doors in all four directions and looking up you see the four windows facing onto the courtyard; above, a patch of blue-grey sky.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                You are in the kitchens, warm and cheerful in spite of the doorway onto the cold courtyard to the west, as there is a roaring fire in the huge open fireplace in the east wall. East also is a doorway into a stairway room, and there are other doorways both north and south.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 You are in a stairway room, part castle, part cavern, where you can climb to the next floor of Hamlet's Castle. There is a doorway to the west.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 You are in a small homely room with a tiled, patterned floor. A cuckoo clock, now wound down, is fastened to the western wall. There are doors to north and south.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              You are in a large cavern, on the west bank of a shallow, fordable lake surrounded by weeds. There is a small doorway in the southwestern wall.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 You are nearly thigh-high in the middle of the lake, between the western and the eastern shore. The water is clear, and you can see in it brightly coloured weeds, waving slowly in the current.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                You are on the east shore of the weed-fronded lake, at the farthest east end of the cavern, where a little spring rises and feeds the lake. It is a quiet, pleasant place; and you guess that Hamlet had it constructed for reflection and relaxation - and also, more prosaically, as a source of water in time of siege.                                                                                                                                                                                                      You are in a well furnished chamber to the east of the entrance hall. North is another, larger room; to the northeast is a small doorway into a large cavern where the castle meets the rock.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   You are in a spacious yet sparse room with scanty furniture and no function that you can see. Exits are north to the open courtyard and south to the entrance hall of the castle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               You are in the entrance hall to Hamlet's Castle, a well-furnished and spacious room. The gates are to the south, to the north and east are other chambers of about the same size.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               You are at the north end of a narrow metal gantry in the northeast tower, suspended perilously over the hard earth floor of the tower, far below. Above you is strange machinery - cogs, wheels, springs - and you surmise that, as the gantry leads no further north, it was constructed purely to allow the observation of this equipment. Unfortunately it means nothing to you. You must go south.                                                                                                                          You are at the south end of the gantry in the northeast tower. It has no rail, and you glance with a shudder at the hard earth floor far below. You have a good view of the machinery above - it looks like some kind of clockwork. There is a doorway in the southern wall and beyond that a passage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          You are on a small observation platform in the northeast tower, from which you can watch the machinery. There is a doorway west, and a metal ladder leads up to a higher platform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              You are in a long, broad north - south passage leading north into the northeast tower, onto a narrow gantry and south into a large room.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        You are on an observation platform at the top of the Clock Tower. East it continues to take you right over the machinery; and an iron ladder leads down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        You are on an observation platform directly above the clockwork in the Clock Tower. The platform continues west, where there is a ladder to take you down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      You are in a large bare cold room, which was once, you think, used as a storehouse - there are still hooks in the ceiling for hanging strings of onions, sides of bacon and so on. There are exits south and west to similar rooms, and in the northeast corner a passage leading north. A small doorway is to the east.                                                                                                                                                                                                        You are in Hamlet's Room, a place simply but comfortably furnished and well proportioned. Here Hamlet keeps watch over his cold northern lands and directs their affairs. There are two windows, one northerly overlooking the land, one southerly facing out over the cobbled courtyard with its sundial far below; and there are two doors, one west and one east.                                                                                                                                                            You are on the roof of Hamlet's Castle, looking over the battlements across the land below - you can see as far as Stilton Gorge. To your north you can look down on the central courtyard - with not so much as a rail to keep you from falling; to your west the cliff which forms the western wall of the castle rises yet higher, too steep to climb.                                                                                                                                                                       You are in a little room half built and half hewn out of the natural rock, with a little window in the east wall overlooking the courtyard below. There is one exit, to the north.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              You are in an old treasure storehouse, once full of beautiful things, now looted and despoiled. A window looks out over the graveyard - scarcely a pleasing view - and there are exits east and north.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          You are in a room for storing items not in use: it has contained at one time or another tapestries, threadbare carpets, costumes, musical instruments, bric-a-brac and unsightly pictures, but now it is almost empty. Exits are south, east and west.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          You are on a crumbling ledge of masonry in the southeast corner of the northwest tower. There is no way from this location in any direction except south.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       You are in a large room, bare yet warm, as it is above the kitchens and the chimney distends the eastern wall. There are exits north and south, and east to a stairway room.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    You are in a stairway room much like the one below it - small, square and with the eastern wall part of the east cliff. Stairs lead both up and down and there is a door in the western wall.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   You are in a well furnished bedchamber, with a high window in the southern wall facing onto the cold southern lands (a picturesque if not a very warming view) and its own wardrobe in the western wall. There is only one doorway, to the north.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               You are in a large mahogany wardrobe, smelling of mothballs and fur coats. East is its door, through which you can pass into a large bedchamber.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                You are at a four-way place between rooms. West is a passageway, north a small room, south a similar room over whose arched doorway has been carved the mysterious word 'PANDORA'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              You are in the southeast corner of the roof of Hamlet's Castle, gazing over the battlements. It affords a good view of the coldlands - you can see the chasm, the ice hills, the cliffs - and dim in the distance Stilton Gorge. The eastern cliff - which is also the eastern wall of the castle - rises high above your head, too steep to climb. West and north the roof continues, northwest you can look out over the cobbled courtyard.                                                                                   You are in a small treasure storehouse in the hidden section of the castle. A window in the north wall overlooks the courtyard. The only door is to the south.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  This is a high, narrow room with whitewashed stone walls and a floor of cracked tiles, puddled with water. It has a single arched door, at one end of the room, and at the opposite end - the south - a window, narrow and barred. The overall effect is offputting; the place is dank and unpleasant, and stinks like a cellar that's been used since time immemorial as a burial-place for rats. Not to have entered would probably have been the healthiest option.                                                          You are in a brief passageway running east - west.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              You are in an oddly shaped cavern which has been incorporated into the main castle. It contains little of interest; the dust has lain undisturbed for years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    You are on a little metal observation platform in the northeast tower, only a few feet west of the complex machinery which it houses. A ladder runs down to another observation platform and up to a higher, larger one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        You are in the northeast corner of the castle roof. There are battlements to the north and east, northeast a tower (though you can find no way in) southwest you can look down onto the courtyard, and south and west the roof continues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       You are on the northwest part of the castle roof. North you can look down over the land, west over the graveyard, northwest is a tower which you cannot enter from here, southeast you can look down over the courtyard (carefully; there is no rail) and east the roof continues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              You are on the east part of the roof of Hamlet's Castle, above the stairway room. There is no view from here, only the cliff to the east (unless you count the view down onto the courtyard). North and south the roof continues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               You're struggling through thick, shadowy forest close to the south of a great wall or cliff which blocks out most of the light coming from the north. Eastwards you can distinctly see some kind of building - old and ruined - through the trees, while south you can enter a small rounded glade, shadowed and overhung by the ancient trees.                                                                                                                                                                                 This is a pleasant sunlit tree-lined avenue, leading north and south. To the south it passes through a pair of mighty wrought-iron gates, once a strong barrier but now hanging crazily on broken hinges; to the north the road leads into a wide courtyard in front of a great palace of some kind, and you could slip through the trees to the east or the west (following a grassy path that leads off the main avenue in this direction).                                                                                   You're in part of the southern grounds of the palace that once housed the kings and lords of the Realm - long since deserted. The immaculate lawn that was once here has grown thick and shaggy, and grass and moss sprout between the cobblestones of the east-west path you stand on. The metal railings to your south - designed to keep the common people out - are rusted. Even the part of the palace directly to your north has ivy climbing among its crumbling bricks.                                                 This is the southwestern edge of the palace grounds; you're at a corner on a garden path - once pleasant and well-kept, now overgrown - that leads east towards an avenue, lined with poplars, and north towards a hill topped by a prospect tower. South is a high wrought iron fence, now rusty, but still serviceable; west you can see a tall stone tower, actually part of the city walls, with a partially ruined brick guardroom (of inferior workmanship) built onto it.                                                This is - or was - the main guardroom of the palace grounds, built as an extension to the older tower of the city walls to the west. Only the shell remains, though, blackened by fire and thrown down as if by mighty engines of war. The roof appears to have come down on the western side, completely blocking the door into the tower itself - you can just see the top of this door over a mound of rubble - so there is only one exit, east into the grounds.                                                            You're on a north-south path leading through an unkempt and dishevelled area of the palace grounds, once an ornamental lawn but now little better than a meadow. West is what used to be an artificial wood, which has undergone a similar fate; north the path climbs a little hill to a prospect tower; and directly to the east is a section of the palace wall, blocking your movement in this direction.                                                                                                                   This is a little clump of trees, once an artificial and carefully pruned copse but now much more wild and unconstrained. To the south is a partially ruined brick building and to the southwest a round tower adjoining it; neither can be entered from here. To the west is the city wall, and you wonder idly if this copse was originally planted to block off view of the unsightly buildings from the prospect tower you can see to the northeast. North the copse continues.                                              You are on the south slope of a gentle hill, topped by a prospect tower. A stepped path leads north-south up the hill here, making it easy to scale; or you can follow the path southwards, or go round the hill to east and west.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              You're standing at the top of a little hill, the centre of the western palace grounds, erected - you guess - to command a view of the grounds, long ago in the days when the City was great and its rulers powerful. You can go down in any direction (a stepped path leads south and down) or into a small prospect tower, built in mock-ancient style, from where you should be able to see most of the western grounds and perhaps even some of the City.                                                                    This is the western slope of an artificial hill topped by a prospect tower. You can go east and up, north or south round the hill, or west down it into a little copse by the western city walls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               You're on the north slope of a small artificial hill which commands good views of the surrounding grounds - such as they are - and is topped by a prospect tower. You can go up the hill to the south, down it to the north towards a walled corner, or west or east round the hill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            You're now on the eastern side of a little hill, not a natural feature but constructed by man (more specifically, a landscape gardener) to allow the lords and masters of the City to survey their domain. It is surmounted by a prospect tower, which you could probably enter if you got to the top of the hill; or you could go down towards a walled section of the grounds, or north or south round the hill.                                                                                                              You are in the palace grounds, standing by a herringbone red-brick wall to the east - part of the palace - and close to a little knoll to the west which is topped by a prospect tower. South your exit is blocked by a similar wall, but north the grounds continue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           You're in a little copse - once an artificial wood, but looking much more natural after having been left to its own devices for years, perhaps centuries. The only immediate sign of man's hand is a wrought iron park bench, standing under the shade of a mighty cedar which must have been tall when the bench was placed here, however long ago. The copse continues southwards, while west is the stone of the great city walls, and east a gentle hill slopes upwards, crowned by some sort of tower.                     This is the furthest northwest you can come in the palace grounds; north is a crumbling red brick wall with an archway in it which you can pass through, while west is a much higher wall, cunningly built of indestructible stone. It is, in fact, the great wall of the city, which has stood for thousands of years and will doubtless stand for thousands more; craning your neck you can make out the ramparts and the walkway for the guards. South is a copse.                                                           This was once a walled garden, where the tender plants would grow away from the cold wind, sheltered on all side. The winds of time have blown through this place, though, and the plants are withered and dead, and the walls crumble in decay and ruin - a whole tower has fallen that was once part of the eastern wall, and destroyed much of the west wing of the palace in its fall, though the wall is still too high to climb. South is an archway and north an orchard.                                                You're in an area of the gardens walled in to east, west and north: still recognisably an orchard, though the trees have been untended many years and the gardeners would not recognise their neat rows in this tangled thicket. South the walled gardens continue, while east there's an archway in a partially damaged brick wall, which you might be able to get through.                                                                                                                                                    This is a corner of the palace grounds, close to the walls of the palace itself to the east and north. As you look at them you see that this ancient building was not unscathed in the disaster that overcame the city - the wall is cracked and crumbled, and looking up you can see that the whole of a tower that would have overshadowed you from the north has fallen leaving only a stump of brick. There's a knoll to the south you could climb, or southeast will take you round it.                                    You're in a courtyard, marble-paved, dominated by a huge fountain in the shape of a gryphon. Though choked with weed and long inoperable, it still retains some of its former glory and brings back echoes of long ago. North is the palace itself, seemingly untouched by time; its door stands open, though, and the golden gates themselves are long gone. West is a smaller yard, east are steps into the gardens and south a tree-lined avenue.                                                                            This small yard is an adjunct to the Court of the Fountain to the east, where the royal messengers and men-at-arms would tether their horses. The stable block - a low, tiled, red-brick building - surrounds you to south and west and can be entered to the south; there's a small door into the main palace to the north. From the west, distantly, you seem to hear the ringing of a hammer on metal.                                                                                                                       This is the stables, where all the horses of the household were fed and watered. Nothing of that remains; the room is completely bare. An exit leads onto the stable yard northwards, and a smaller door leads west.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            You're in the ostler's room, a small unfurnished chamber where the stablemen would sleep when the day was over, with a single window high in the western wall. Doors lead north and east; from the northern door comes the sound of someone or something hammering on metal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    You have entered the smithy, where the horses were shod. All around are examples of the smith's art and tools of his trade - most of them far too heavy for a weakling like you to lift. Despite the daylight streaming in from windows to the east and west, the smithy is lit up by the red glow of a forge set in the north wall - presumably operated by magic, as there are no bellows that you can see. An arched doorway leads southwards, the only exit.                                                                You have entered the formal gardens of the palace and are on an east-west gravelled path leading west into a courtyard (up a little flight of steps) and east into the centre of the gardens. Unlike the western section of the grounds, these gardens are largely intact and the flowers still bloom in their stylised, ornate patterns as though somebody has been tending them.                                                                                                                                              This is the centre of the palace's formal gardens, a small gravelled square where paths from north, west, east and south meet. In the centre of the square stands a pedestal, once, you guess, the support for a statue or fountain, now vanished: this is the only sign of the damage done in the fall of the city, though, and the gardens themselves are as well-tended as they must ever have been.                                                                                                                         You're walking down a gravelled north-south path in the formal gardens of the palace, a pleasant area untouched by the devastation that has overtaken much of the rest of the City. South is the centre of the gardens and northwards you can see a summerhouse, close to the walls of the palace itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       You're on an east-west path in formal gardens which leads west to their centre and east joins a wide hedged avenue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             A north-south path in the formal gardens leading north to the centre of this area and south through a garden gate into a field of long grass. Some distance to the north you can see a summerhouse, set on an immaculate lawn and close to the walls of the palace itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      You have entered a large field of unkempt grass, once a well-mown lawn but long since left to run wild. South is an iron fence, the southern boundary of the palace grounds: east a high thorn hedge blocking movement in that direction. You can go west, though, slipping between tall poplars onto the driveway of the palace, or north through a gate onto a gravelled path in a better-kept area than this.                                                                                                                This is a wide path surrounded to north and south by tall privet hedges  which block your movement in these directions. You can go west, however, where the path comes out into the open and enters the formal gardens of the palace, or east: in this direction the hedged avenue continues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   You're at a corner on a wide garden path, surrounded north and east by tall hedges. South you can enter a hedge maze, while west will take you towards less enclosed areas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     You are walking down a gravelled north-south path to the west of a well-mown lawn and to the east of the palace walls. South the path enters the palace formal gardens, while north you can get into a little summerhouse nestling in a corner between the walls to the west and those further north.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           This is an immaculate lawn, kept in pristine condition since the departure of the lords of the Realm either by dedicated gardeners or by powerful magic. In either case, the owners won't want you walking on it, so I should tread carefully if I were you... North are the walls of the palace, the windows looking down at you as you cross the lawn: south is the formal garden, fenced off to prevent you trampling the beds of delicate flowers, and east the lawn continues. West is a path.                             You're on a carefully mown area of the palace lawns, by the look of it a bowling green. The lawn continues to west and east, while north are the walls of the palace and south a high hedge which blocks your way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              You've come to the eastern end of the palace lawns, which despite the desertion of the City long ago have remained undamaged and look much the same as they must once have done when they were trodden by the Kings of the Land. Here the lawn meets the city wall (to the east); your way south is also blocked, by a tall hedge, but you can go west across a bowling green or north through a small door in the palace wall.                                                                                                 This is a small storeroom, once the living quarters for the gardeners who tended the lawns and fountains of this area. Nothing much now remains. A door leads south into the gardens, the only exit: another door to the west has been bricked up and is completely impassable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 You have entered a little summerhouse, whose windows look over the lawns to the south and east, the formal gardens further south, and beyond them the hedge maze. The summerhouse itself has clearly not been used for many years - its once bright and cheerful paint is now peeling and faded, the iron benches around the walls are corroded and decayed, and a thin layer of dust has settled over everything. The whole place has an aura of decay.                                                                        You are in the conservatory, once a place where exotic plants were stored and tended by the gardeners for the enjoyment of the lords of the Realm. However, it has long since been ruined: the west tower, which once stood south of you, has fallen, or been thrown down, leaving only a stump, and has destroyed most of the area around it. As a result there is only one exit, to the west: those to the south and east are buried under a mound of rubble.                                                                 This is the main entrance hall of the palace, built modestly in marble with gold fittings. An unobtrusive ten-foot wide carved oaken staircase leads up and east from here: to the south is the entrance itself, and you can pass through this into a sunlit courtyard. Other exits are north, through a lofty archway - from which direction you can also see sunlight - or west through a small wooden door.                                                                                                                  You've entered the guardroom, where the men-at-arms who guarded the palace would sit and quaff ale in their leisure hours. A sturdy wooden table stands in one corner, still stained with wine and beer, but nothing else remains. There are exits to north, south, west and east through studded wooden doors, the southern one leading out into daylight. Over the western door a sign reads "ARMOURY - NO UNAUTHORISED PERSONNEL." In the southeastern corner is a flight of steps, leading down.                            You are in the palace armoury, a place where the guards would store their deadly weapons when they weren't in use. Most of the weapon cupboards are, unfortunately, heavily padlocked, so that you can't get into them. A door leads east into the guardroom.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   This is a great oaken stairway, leading down into the marble hall and up to a landing. The treads have been polished by many feet, and are slippery, so take care!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              You are on the landing, between a flight of broad oaken stairs to the west, leading down, and another to the north, leading up. Oak railings stop you going in other directions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                This is a bright daylit passage, south of a great courtyard and separated from it by a stone colonnade. You can slip between two of the mighty pillars, or you can go east along the passage, west towards a small and unobtrusive door at the western end of the corridor, or south through a high archway into a marble hall.                                                                                                                                                                                                 You're in an east-west corridor, southeast of a bright courtyard (which you can enter by slipping between two of the high pillars which form a colonnade around it). North is a similar passage, to the east of the courtyard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  A north-south passage, west of a courtyard and separated from it by a row of pillars that form a colonnade.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     This is an east-west passage north of a large bright courtyard, which you can enter by going between two of the high pillars which surround it. North a hefty bronze door stands ajar, and you can go through it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               You are walking down a north-south passage east of a large open  courtyard, which you can enter by going west between the pillars which form a colonnade round it. East is a door, on which are engraved the words "OF THE TWO THAT ENTER HERE, ONLY ONE MUST LEAVE ALIVE."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     This is an east-west corridor in the palace, close to a large window of leaded lights, to the south, through which you can see the lawn and - further south - the formal gardens.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               You have entered a large open courtyard in the centre of the palace. Paved with marble and surrounded by tall sandstone pillars that form a colonnade around it (you can pass between the pillars into the shade of passages behind them) it is a pleasant place. Looking up, you can see what must be the windows of the second storey - three of them, in the west, north and south walls.                                                                                                                                    This was the servants' quarters, inhabited by the lackeys, servitors, domestics, menials, drudges, scullions and scullery maids, turnspits, kitchen wenches, slaveys and other riff-raff that made up the staff of the palace. All are now gone, and the place is just a long, bare, stone - flagged room. Doors lead to the west, north, east and south.                                                                                                                                                                       You have entered what was the butler's room, set aside from the quarters of the other domestics to the east by reason of his higher status. He would hardly recognise it now, though, for in the fall of the City and the destruction of most of its buildings the West Tower - the stump of which can be seen to the west - fell onto the room above, causing the whole lot to collapse into this room. You can pick your way across the rubble to exits west and east.                                                        You're in the base of the West Tower - all that remains, for the rest fell some time ago destroying most of the west wing of the palace with it. It's not a safe place to stay. Steps lead down into darkness, or you can head east into another room: the exit that was north of here has been choked by rubble and the walls to the west and south, though damaged, are still serviceable.                                                                                                                                    This is the kitchens, once a busy and bustling place, now deserted and partially damaged - the western wall is crumbled and shafts of daylight gleam through the broken ceiling, while bricks and mortar lie scattered on the floor. The exit to the west has been choked by a fall of rubble and is impassable, but you can go east or south through studded wooden doors.                                                                                                                                                     You're at the western end of the Great Banqueting Hall. Chairs and benches lie overturned here, as if the inhabitants had only just fled the room, but dust lies thick over the benches and the great wooden table alike, spiders have spun their webs between the gaps, and rats have long ago carried off the food, while looters have taken the golden and silver plates and cups, so that in short this is a dismal place. Doors lead west and south.                                                                       This is the east end of the Banqueting Hall, and - like the western end - has an air of death and decay about it. The chairs and benches are strewn about in disarray and the great throne, once the property of the King, lies on its back, hewn with many axe-blows - presumably from adventurers trying to remove the gold leaf. No doors lead off from this end of the hall, though you can see a couple of exits in the western end of the room.                                                                           You have come to the eastern end of a long east-west corridor, lit by tall windows in the southern wall which look out over the gardens - providing a view which contrasts sharply with the bare uninteresting stone of the corridor itself. There was once a door to the east, but for some reason it has been roughly bricked up; so you can either go west, or north up a flight of dark narrow steps. A sign beside them says "STRICTLY NO ENTRY."                                                                          You're about halfway up a flight of steps, gloomy and dark. North is up, to a landing; south is down to a corridor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             You've come to a small landing, at the top of two flights of narrow steps to the north and south of you. A door stands ajar to the west, and sunlight comes through the crack; but northwards the darkness is absolute.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         You're standing in a small shrine, the centrepiece of which is a tall pillar of some black stone surmounted by a carved skull, five times life-size. A door leads north, though you can't see what lies beyond it; south is a flight of steps leading up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       This is a small circular room, with a pit in the floor where the rulers of the City would sacrifice treasures to their idol. A door leads south into a shrine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  You're on a wide carved oak stairway, leading north and up to a passage and south and down to a landing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        This is an east-west passage, carpeted and ornate, with a carved wooden door in the southern wall. A narrow window, to the north, looks down over a sunlit courtyard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           You have entered the Grand Bedchamber, a sumptuous room where the most important and mighty in the Realm were privileged to sleep. Although the silken hangings and embroidered tapestries are long gone, the room still has a certain dignity of proportion and the four-poster bed against the eastern wall is a masterpiece of wood carving. Oaken doors lead west and north, and a great window in the southern wall overlooks the gardens and the Court of the Fountain.                                                   You have entered a wide, sandy-floored area, open to the elements, with a single door to the west. As you look more closely you see that mingled with the sand are little patches of blood, and here and there bones protrude from the dust. This is in fact the Arena, where condemned men and gladiators would fight to the death before the Lords of the City - you can see a gallery high in the eastern walls where they could stand and watch the sport.                                                                  This was the bathroom adjoining the Grand Bedchamber to the east. Though the fittings are all gone - looted long ago - the marble tiles and the sunken bath still remain, and your imagination can supply the rest - the heated water, the perfumed oils and unguents, the deferential servants, and so on. A frosted-glass window to the west stands ajar and you can look out over the gardens - and further west, across the city walls, you can see sunlight on the sea.                                                    This is a corner in an opulent carpeted passage, leading north one way and east another.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        You're in a wide and carpeted passage, leading east-west. The upper stories of the palace were the living quarters of the most powerful in the Realm, and are correspondingly luxurious, even extending to wide bay windows in the southern wall overlooking the formal gardens and the lawn. Directly to your south, though, is a wide oaken stairway which leads downwards to the ground floor.                                                                                                                               This is the east end of an east-west passage which extends the length of the first floor. An archway in the north wall leads into a small stone room.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           This is the base of the East Tower, and a metal ladder leads up through a trapdoor in the roof to what is presumably its top. (As this is the first floor, there must be a room below this one, but there's no way into it that you can see.) There are open doors to south and north; over the latter a sign reads "BE SURE TO SET PROPER COMBINATION BEFORE ENTERING." There is also a combination lock in the wall, but somebody's smashed it with a battleaxe...                                                            You are in a north-south tunnel which slopes down quite steeply to the north. To the south you can enter a small stone room.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    This is a steeply-sloping north-south tunnel, leading down to the north and up to the south. Northwards it enters a room, but the darkness inside is such that you can't see any details of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 You're in a curious little room in the shape of a right-angled triangle, with the hypotenuse being on the northeastern side and the southern wall being the shortest edge. As the room has no windows - it is in fact completely dark, except insofar as your light illuminates it - you can't see where you are in the palace or why the room is built like this.                                                                                                                                                              You are at a three-way junction where carpeted passages lead north, south and west. Westwards you can see daylight at the end of the tunnel. A door in the eastern wall is labelled "GUEST ROOM."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               This east-west passage once led westwards to the West Tower. It does so no longer, for at its western end you can look through what was once a doorway down at the stump of the tower, which fell long ago. Although you can also get a good view of the walled gardens and the orchard from here, it is not a safe place to stand, as the brickwork which supports you is severely damaged. You can go east along the passage to a junction or north to a door.                                                                This was once a corner in a wide carpeted passage, leading east one way and south the other. Unfortunately most of the passage here appears to have slid down into the west end of the kitchens, fifteen feet below, and not only is it necessary to squeeze round the corner on a narrow ledge, but you must negotiate a two-foot wide chasm in the eastern passage right next to it.                                                                                                                                          You're in a carpeted east-west passage, near to a doorway to the north. The passage comes to an end further east and rounds a damaged corner to the west (damaged to the extent that you'll have to jump over a wide chasm in the floor and then edge round the corner on what remains of the carpet!) South is a narrow slit window which overlooks an open-air courtyard.                                                                                                                                                     You have arrived at the east end of an east-west passage and are standing by a large wooden door on the north side of the corridor. A brass plate on the door reads "The Right Honourable, Azarik Quimbar, Lord Chancellor. Do not disturb" but the door stands ajar and you guess that the Chancellor has long since joined his ancestors.                                                                                                                                                                                     A stairway alcove, with doors to north and south and a spiral stair leading up. The north door is carved with runes and occult symbols.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         This is the Court Magician's room, and as with most of the other rooms in the palace that would once have contained items of use to you, it is now completely empty of all the magical gear - it has been raided, not once, but many times. A door leads out to the south into a little alcove, and in the northeastern corner is a small door carved with a reasonable representation of the Giant Rat of Sumatra.                                                                                                             This eighteen-inch ledge is all that remains of the Chamberlain's room - the rest did not survive the natural disaster at the time of the fall of the city. In fact, the room below - which you can see clearly by leaning forward a little - appears to have caved in taking the floor of this room with it. A door leads south; as the other exits involve a fifteen-foot drop onto a mound of rubble, you'd better rule these out of consideration...                                                                        You have entered the Guest Room, an airy and spacious chamber set apart for those visitors who didn't merit the Grand Bedchamber at the front of the palace. Sadly, looters have stripped it down to the bare stone walls and floor, so there's nothing for you to pinch; but a window in the eastern wall affords a good view into a central courtyard below, while a mahogany door leads westwards.                                                                                                                           You are in the Chancellor's Room, a luxurious chamber befitting the one who controlled the Realm's finances in the days when the City was a trade centre for all Middle-earth. Although such trivia as solid platinum inkwells are long gone, there's still some extremely nice oak panelling on the walls (not removable...) Doors are to south and east - the eastern one's reinforced to deter thieves, though it looks like someone's tried to break it down.                                                               You have entered the Great Treasury - nice trick if you can do it - and are able to look around at the room where all the treasures of the Kingdom are stored. Mostly they're in great iron-bound chests, firmly locked and out of your reach, though there might be something knocking around that's worth getting. The only door (to the west) is a strong oaken one reinforced with strong metal bars. There's also a trapdoor in the ceiling, but it's much too high for you to reach.                                      This is the Changing Room, where the best laid plans of mice and men sometimes get a bit mixed up. The only exit is west, though if you're reading this, it probably means that you won't be able to get back...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                You are in a secret room where a narrow flight of stairs leads up. The southern wall is oak panelling and there's a concealed door in this that you can go through if you want (it will probably not be visible on the other side, though).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     This is the top of the East Tower. Emerging into the open air you look around - the view's certainly worth the climb. South you can see straight down to the lawn, then the formal garden, then the hedge maze and the driveway, and beyond those the City. North and west you can see over the palace, while east you can look over the City walls to the Realm. The only note of discord is the flagpole, broken two feet up, which you feel should be flying a proud flag.                                                   This is a landing on a spiral staircase which leads up and down from here. A door is to the north: a brass plate on it reads "LIBRARY."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         You're in the western section of the library, a place where the most ancient and magical books of the Realm were collected by the lords of the City. The books are still here, locked away in cases of reinforced steel and magically toughened glass to keep off vandals and those who want to know too much. To the east the library continues, and a door leads south. In the northwestern corner is a large and ornate desk.                                                                                                You've entered the eastern section of a large library, the walls lined with bookshelves filled with imposing tomes, all securely locked away out of the reach of meddling hands. To your surprise, you notice that the shelves at the east end of the room are slightly out of line with the wall: in fact, they seem to form a door through which you could pass into darkness. Alternatively you can enter the west end of the library.                                                                                       You find yourself in a small dark north-south passage. The air is stale and cold. To the south the passage leads into a large room of some kind, you think, while north are some steps leading downwards. There's a rough wooden door in the western wall, without handle or keyhole, which you could push open and go through if you wanted.                                                                                                                                                                                   This dark unfurnished room was once, you guess, a hiding place for someone who needed concealment from his enemies. Probably untended even before the palace became deserted, it now smells of dust and decay. The only exit is an opening in the northeastern corner, leading north.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           You are on a narrow flight of steep stairs leading up and down from here. The steps are unlit and the treads narrow, and you have to concentrate to keep yourself from falling headlong.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        This is a stairway alcove. Spiral stairs lead down, and up to the tower top. There's a door to the north, with a golden crown of ornate design painted on its smooth surface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   You have entered the Royal Bedroom, the place where the sovereign of the land used to sleep. Naturally then it was a luxurious place filled with valuables of every kind... equally obviously they have all long ago been pinched by thieving so&so's like your good self. The only exit is south, through a large wooden door.                                                                                                                                                                                                 This is the very top of the North Tower, the highest tower of the palace. From here you can look across the roofs at the other three towers - one of them ruined - and see the courtyards and a large sand-lined area which looks like a gladiatorial ampitheatre. In the centre of the tower is a large flagpole, reaching proudly to the sky. The only exit is down through a trapdoor onto a spiral staircase.                                                                                                               This is a dark earth-floored cellar below the remnants of the West Tower. Steps lead up while a gaping opening, like a lipless mouth, opens to the east. Above this ominous portal is carved in antique script the single word "LABYRINTH."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     You have entered a dungeon, dark, bare and unfriendly. The iron door that used to bar the way out of this location (to the east) now stands ajar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               You are in a bare cold chamber beneath the guardroom. Iron doors - once kept locked, but now open - lead west and east, and a ladder of the same metal leads up. Set in the floor, and somewhat incongruous, is a well of some shining black stone filled with a swirling vortex of glowing colours that lend their hues to the walls and ceiling of the chamber, giving it a magical aspect. Steps lead down to it.                                                                                                            This is the underground torture chamber where murderers, enemies of the state and those who criticised the cut of the King's beard were dealt with as befitted their crime. The instruments of torture - the rack, the thumbscrews, the shackles, the branding irons, the scourges and the cauldron to melt lead - are scattered around in disarray, while in one corner an Iron Maiden of Nuremburg stands open to reveal its deadly spikes. An iron door leads west.                                                          You're inside the Iron Maiden, hardly a pleasant place to stay with the bloodstained spikes digging into your back. It might be best to leave this place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       This is the base of the Prospect Tower, set on a low hill to allow the best possible view over the landscaped gardens. The tower itself is bare, though benches are around the walls: the idea was that you could look out through the windows to west, northwest, southwest and south and wouldn't need a great deal of comfort. An iron staircase leads up to the open top of the tower, and a door leads out.                                                                                                                You've come to the top of the Prospect Tower, and can look around you at the gardens beneath. East and north the high palace walls overshadow the tower, while southeast you can see the roofs of the stable block; but the ornamental wood to the west and southwest, and the lawns to the south still retain some of their old form from this height, while northwest the walled gardens and the orchard seem warm and pleasant. Iron steps lead down to ground level.                                                        You're at a corner in a warm roofed passage northeast of a courtyard and separated from it by a colonnade. The passage leads west and south from here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          You have entered the Royal Box, the room above the Arena where the nobility of the city could watch the spectacle of gladiators in combat with wild beasts or criminals. The western end of the room is a balcony, and from this you can look down at the sandy-floored amphitheatre below. A single door leads east.                                                                                                                                                                                                           This is a small narrow flight of stairs, leading up to the south and down to the north. Northwards the darkness is impenetrable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                This is a corner in a warm roofed passage, northwest of a courtyard but separated from it by a colonnade. The passage leads east and south from here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           You've come to a corner in one of the internal passages of the palace. The passage leads east and north, but there's a small door to the west which you could pass through, while to the northeast there is a large open courtyard, separated from the passage by a colonnade, which you can enter by passing between two of its pillars.                                                                                                                                                                                       This is the Minotaur's room, the centre of the labyrinth. The stone walls are carved with ancient patterns, some runic inscriptions now impossible to describe, others depicting gory rituals of blood sacrifice to the evil creature whose lair this is. Across the grey floor of the chamber are scattered many bones, the remains of the monster's victims, while in places the flagstones are darkened by dried blood.                                                                                                      You are at a junction in the labyrinth, a meeting of passages which all look horribly alike.

You are at a junction in the labyrinth, a meeting of passages which all look horribly alike. On one of the walls somebody has carved the letter "X" but there's nothing else to mark this location out.

This is the centre of the hedge maze, a pleasant spot: quiet and sheltered from the wind by the hedges which surround you on all sides. There's an iron park bench here, presumably to allow the weary travellers who negotiated the maze to sit down after their wanderings; but its green paint is peeling and the iron is rusty beneath it. Travellers or visitors have not been this way for many years.

You are in your boat on the forest pool. It is quiet and peaceful here, and you can lie back in your boat, looking up at the sky and the crowding trees, or down into the deep black waters where great fish swim lazily among the waterweeds. The north and south banks are too high for you to land, but you can row east or west; to the east great ancient willows throng the waterside.                                                                                                                                    You are in a pleasant wooded area to the south of the cliff. To the southwest are the ruins of the gatehouse and almonry, and southeast the abbey church tower still stands, tall among the surrounding trees. West, east and south are other woods similar to these.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           This is the domain of Nanjusi, God of Death and Destruction. Flames spring up around at random intervals, gushing like tongues of lava. High above you can see a column of rock leading up to an ornate throne, painted with real gold, while to the east is an ornately carved portal leading through into a darkened room. Moans and screams of mortal agony rack through your soul and echo mournfully around you. You realise that Doomsday cannot be far away.                                                             This room is dank and evil, with cold, dark bricks covering the walls which seem not to reflect light. Standing in the centre of the room is an ornately carved black marble desk, supporting a few black-bound books which you dare not touch. In the far corner stands a precious jade statue of a beautiful young woman whose eyes seem to sparkle and still contain life. The west wall holds a portal which is surrounded by the statues of various dragons.                                                               You are in a room that seems to throb with the red glow of lust. There are few ornaments here. However there is a glowing red throne pulsing in time with the throb. The throne is surrounded by a strange pentacle which fills you with such fear you cannot summon enough courage to go near it. There are no windows or doors apart from a huge pair of lips on one wall with the words "Kiss Me" underneath them.                                                                                                           This is the northeast corner of the downlands, just south and west of the abbey woods. To the south are some sickly-looking grasslands, while to the west the downs continue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   You are in woods some way south of the abbey. This place is pleasant enough, but the trees seem somehow cramped and stunted, not as healthy as those to the north. To the south the trees are in a sorrier state still, entirely warped and withered, drooping by the banks of a foul lake. There are also woods similar to these to the east, while to the west the trees trail off into grasslands.                                                                                                                           You are among stunted trees some distance south of the abbey; to the west are similar woods. Northwards and eastwards the forest seems fresher and more alive, while further south the trees are withered and blackened, wilting sadly on the black shores of an unpleasant lake; they can scarcely be alive at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                            You are in an area of sick and withered grass to the south of downlands. To the west the land seems healthier, while to the east are the shores of an evil-looking lake, where the grass gives way to clumps of withered and stunted trees. To the south this dismal country continues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         This is the northwestern shore of a pungent lake. This area was once green forest, but the foul water has poisoned the soil, and the trees, though still standing, are blackened, their limbs twisted and scorched, brittle and overgrown by putrid yellow-white fungi. To the north the woods are more healthy, while to the south, along the western shore, little grows at all. To the east the trees continue along the sad shore and to the west they give way to grasslands.                                              You stand among dead or dying trees, grown poorly in the poisoned soil, their wood black and charred and brittle and their bark flaking, their limbs twisted and their growth stunted. Loathsome yellow-white fungi grow and feed upon them. To the south a fuming lake slowly washes; in all other directions are more trees.                                                                                                                                                                                                  You are on the north shore of the bitter lake, among the stunted, withered, charred, brittle and fungus-laden trees of the area. West these trees continue; you cannot see what lies to the north or east, as all the land in those directions is hidden in a thick white swirling mist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        You are in the south of an area of sick and withered grass. To the west the grasslands seem healthier, but to the east are the shores of an evil-looking lake, where little grows. The lands to the south are mostly bare of vegetation as well, being choked and poisoned by ash.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              You are on the western shore of an unpleasant and acrid lake. The soil here is poisoned and only a few spiky tufts of black grass grow, although further north you can see some clusters of stunted and withered trees. To the south these shores continue and to the west are scrubby grasslands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              You are in ashlands, where light cinders have piled in dunes against the green knoll to your west. To the north are grasslands, but no grass grows here, only a few shrubs with sharp and over-bright blooms on thorny stems and broad sticky fly-trap leaves. To the south these ashlands continue, while to the east are the black soil shores of an evil-looking lake. To your southeast a black crag rises from the ash; it is too steep to climb.                                                                          You are on the black muddy western shore of a bitter lake. To the north these shores continue and to the west are ashlands. To the south a sheer black crag rises from the mud. It would be quite impossible to climb; even if it had been possible once, you can see that all the handholds have been chiselled away and smoothed down.                                                                                                                                                                                        You are in the northwest corner of the acid lake, to the south of the shore of the dying trees. From the surface of the water yellow- grey fumes rise slowly; they sting your skin, burn at the back of your throat and taste acid and metallic. East and south the lake continues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             You are in the acid lake, near to the northern shore of stunted trees. The bitter yellow-grey fumes rising from the lake bite at your skin, sting your eyes and make you cough and choke. West and south the lake continues, but east is a high earthen bank which you can't climb.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             You are in the southwestern corner of the acid lake, to the north of a steep muddy cliff three yards or so high. To the west is the black and poisoned shore and north and east the lake continues. Thin wraiths of some yellow-grey gas drift up from the lake, making you cough, choke and sneeze. To the southeast, rising from the acid, is a tall sheer crag of black rock.                                                                                                                                                This is the very heart of the acid lake, where the fumes are strongest; you hardly dare open your eyes, but peering through half-closed lids you can make out that there is an earth bank, too high to climb, blocking the way to the south and west. Your best bet is not to hang around but to make for the northern or the western shore.                                                                                                                                                                                    These are dismal grey lands where ash and cinders have been blown up against the green knoll to the west. No grass grows here, only a few gaudy spiky blooms with prickly stems and broad sticky leaves for catching flies. North these lands continue, while to the west they give way to grey fens. To your east is a great sheer crag of black rock, completely unclimbable.                                                                                                                                                 You are clinging to the iron ladder fastened to the black cliff. Below you are the grasslands to the north of the lighthouse; above, the flattened top of the dark crag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        You are on the flat top of the crag. You can see that there was once some great building here; it appears to have been destroyed - perhaps by fire - and now only a few heaps of blackened rubble remain. From this vantage point you can see north to the abbey, east and south as far as the mist, and west to the ruined watchtower and beyond. A metal ladder is fastened to the southern side of the crag, and seems to be the only way to descend.                                                                        This area has been used for the dumping of waste; although much tall concealing grass grows here, the ground and vegetation reek of some foul tar or oil - this whole area of grasslands would be reduced to ashes at the first spark. To the east the ground is heaped with slag hills, to the south are more grasslands, dotted with tree-stumps; to the north the ground has given way, leaving a steep drop down to an evil-looking lake. To your west a black crag rises, sheer, unclimbable and high.                     You are among grey hills of slag and dirt and waste from the time when the orc-lords joined in the struggle for power. To the north is a sheer drop into a foul lake; at some time or other the ground gave way, leaving a crumbling earth cliff. To the west and south are grasslands, those to the south dotted with tree-stumps. To the east are the black walls of a stern and ecclesiastical-looking building.                                                                                                             You are in the black chapel, a dismal and oppressively religious building; it has an aura of dark sins and their harsher penances. The high narrow windows are grimy and clouded and admit little light. There is only one door, to the south.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  You are in flat, featureless, dismal country; the northeastern fen. It is grey with scattered cinders from the ashlands to the north, and stinks of ash and damp. To your east are more pleasant grassy lands, to your northeast a black and unclimbable crag and to your southeast a clean white lighthouse. South and west the fens continue.                                                                                                                                                                                 You are in grasslands to the north of the lighthouse. To your north is a steep black crag; a tall iron ladder firmly bolted to the rock reaches from the firm grassy ground to the very summit of the cliff. To your west are some grey and rather depressing fens, while to your east the grasslands continue, dotted here and there with the stumps of trees.                                                                                                                                                                 You are in a green and grassy land dotted with tree-stumps; this might once have been a small wood, for the grass and stumps continue to the east. To your north and west there are also grasslands and to your south there is a slope up to the top of a cliff. Northwest is a sheer and unclimbable crag of black rock; to your southwest is a tall white lighthouse.                                                                                                                                                         You are in grasslands strewn with tree-stumps - the last remains of a wood - which continue to the west. South is a slope up to a cliff top and north some grey slaghills. To your east is the graveyard to a chapel. In the centre of these fields stands one tree not yet felled, an odd and slightly sinister looking thing, which you might be able to climb.                                                                                                                                                               You are high in the branches of an evil tree, a nasty black malformed thing with a stench of carrion and decay. Below you are more pleasant grasslands, dotted with tree stumps. Above you the tree's limbs become too slender and fragile to climb; you will have to go back down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             You are in the graveyard of the black chapel. The site seems to have been ill-chosen, for the whole cemetery is awash so that in places you are forced to wade. The gravestones are crumbling and moss-grown and any writing on them cannot be deciphered. To the north you might enter the chapel, to the west are grasslands and tree-stumps and to your south there is a slope up to the top of a cliff. A thick white mist rolls in from the east. This place is distinctly depressing.                                     You are in grey fens west of a white lighthouse; as the door is on the southern side you cannot enter from here. North and west the fens continue and to the south is a swamp by the sea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       You are on a pleasant grassy slope up to the top of a cliff, to the southeast. To the south or east you could walk around the slope, to the north are pleasant tree-stump-strewn grasslands and to your west your way is blocked by the white walls of a lighthouse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            You are on the green and grassy side of a little hill, which slopes upwards to the south. West and east you can walk around the hill, and to your north are pleasant grassy lands dotted with tree-stumps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      You are on a muddy slope southwestwards up to the top of a cliff. South and west you can walk around the side of the little hill, east you could go to an area of ash and mud, or north you could visit some sort of graveyard. To your northeast the land is covered by a thick white mist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    This is an area of mud and soft grey dunes of ash. To your west are the lower slopes of a little hill, or you could go south - though the land there seems swampy and treacherous, perhaps it would be better not to trust your weight to it. You cannot see what might lie to the north or east; all that land is clothed in a thick white swirling mist.                                                                                                                                                                      You are in sinking mud, which is slowly sucking you down. To your north are lands of mud and ash, or to your west you might begin to climb the muddy slopes of a little hill. To the east the land is covered in mist and to the south is a mist-swathed slow and dismal sea, which you find frightening and unwelcoming in a way which you cannot understand.                                                                                                                                                                  You have come to the easternmost corner of the swamp, a dismal place scattered with ashes. To your north are grey fens, or to your east there are dunes of sand and cinders. To the south is a dull and listless sea shrouded with mist; you feel a strange desire to stay away. Northeast your way is blocked by the white walls of a lighthouse.                                                                                                                                                                              You are toiling through soft sticky dunes of grey ash, the shore to a sinister and misty sea to the south. To your north is the doorway to a white lighthouse; you might go in. West is the eastern edge of a swamp and east are the lower slopes of a little hill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             You are on the western slope of a little hill. To your south the ground ends abruptly in a cliff; beneath are sharp rocks and the grey and misty sea. To your north you could walk around the side of the hill, or you could go down to the west, to an area of ash dunes. To the northwest your way is blocked by the white walls of a white lighthouse.                                                                                                                                                                       You are at the highest point of the little hill. To the south is a sheer drop. Below, you can see soft grey ash dunes and further south, the sea. North, west and east you can descend the hill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                You are in soft grey ash dunes at the foot of a cliff too steep to climb, to the north. West, east and south you are surrounded by the grey and misty sea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      You are on the eastern slope of a little hill. To your south the ground has given way and there is a steep fall; below, you can see cruel rocks in a misty sea. To your north you might walk around the slope of the hill, or you might go down to the east; this area, however, is one of sinking mud, and it might not be safe to trust your weight to it.                                                                                                                                                                    You are on grey and misty seas. It is impossible to see more than a few yards ahead of you in any direction, and you are out of sight of the shore. You cannot tell which is the best direction to row, but you feel a violent compulsion to leave these sinister waters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       You are in the lowest room of the lighthouse, which has been decorated with dark runes and strange symbols. Drawn on the wall in red ink is a map of the Realm and the surrounding lands, written over with signs of power. There are no doors to this room, the only exit is up the iron ladder through the hole in the ceiling. Around this hole has been written the word 'ABRACADABRA' in large sea-blue letters.                                                                                                           You are in the entrance hall to the lighthouse, a clean bare whitewashed room with many windows high in the walls. An iron ladder leads down into a lower darkened room and a flight of spiral stairs leads upwards. Above the arch of the stairs are written the words 'SLEEPING BEAUTY' in bold black on the white stone.                                                                                                                                                                                                     You are on the spiral stairs in the lighthouse, between one room and the next. This place is dark and quite cold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               This is the topmost room of the lighthouse, from which the light used to shine as a warning to ships. The lantern is gone but the strange coloured windows remain, so that the room is illuminated by a dim red light. Apart from a few long shards of broken glass beneath your feet the room is clean and bare. The only exit is down the spiral staircase.                                                                                                                                                                   This is the room where the Immortals meet and convene, talking of matters which are above Mortal understanding. Paintings of dragons in combat and of powerful mages adorn the walls, most notably a portrait of the first mortal granted the prestigious title of wizard, Bluewing. Against the wall lies a comfortable leather sofa, and a large round table is in the centre of the room.                                                                                                                                    You are holding on firmly to a rope ladder which leads up the side of a large galleon. Below you is the sea, coming closer and then moving away again in great swoops, which are both uncomfortable and unnerving, as a result of the rolling of the ship. Though the ladder here is some distance away from the galleon's side, it passes over the edge of the ship some way further up and looks more secure there. Or you could drop down into the sea.                                                                      You're on a sturdy rope ladder hanging over the side of a galleon. Here you are close to the overhanging edge of the ship and can touch the smooth wood of her side, but further down the rope dangles precariously above the sea. If you climbed a bit further you could get up to the rim of the boat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        You're standing on the port edge of a large sailing ship, directly west of the main mast - the bows are pointing due north. The ship seems deserted: no flag is flying and no sail hoisted. You can't go south or north, as you are only kept in position here by holding onto the main mast's rigging, and you'd fall into the sea: but you can climb the rigging, go east onto the deck, or climb down a rope ladder that hangs over the ship's edge towards the water.                                                       This is the quarterdeck of a large sailing ship, and you're standing close to the large main mast. Although the ship is trim and clean, there is no sign of any crew, and you guess she's drifting, out of control. To the west it's possible to get onto the port edge of the galleon, where you could climb the rigging: or you could go north to the foredeck, south towards a cabin, or up a ladder to the south onto the poop deck.                                                                                        You're on the foredeck of a large galleon which seems to have been recently abandoned by its crew - without apparent reason. The prow points northwards, but the ship is making no headway and no sails are hoisted. Looking over the side you can see open gunports and rows of cannon, but no sign of life, and the hatches that would have allowed access to the main deck below are nailed and bolted securely. Your only exit is south to the quarterdeck.                                                                 This is the captain's cabin, entered by a door from the quarterdeck to the north. The room is bare and sparsely furnished, as befits a room that might have to be cleared for action at any time. Its main features are large barred windows looking out on the sea to the west, east and south.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                You are now on the poop deck of the galleon, the highest deck and the nearest to the stern. Like the rest of the boat it's clean and neat as if it had just been scrubbed: and like the rest of the boat, it seems to be completely deserted. The only sign of damage is a splintered hole in the planks of the deck that must once have supported the ship's wheel. The only exit is a ladder at the north end leading down to the quarterdeck.                                                                                You're about halfway up the rigging of a galleon. Above you is the crow's nest and further down the rigging meets the edge of the ship. You have to grip tightly as the boat rolls beneath you and the ropes twist in the wind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 This is the crow's nest, close to the top of the main mast of a large sailing ship which you can see spread out below you. This is the place the lookout would have watched from, before the ship was abandoned, and once you've got used to the rolling of the boat you can see a long way from here - as far as the coast to the east. The sea is empty of other boats, as far as you can make out, and you may as well descend - by climbing down the rigging - to the deck.                                                 This imposing chamber is part of the headquarters of the Guild of Artisans, a powerful body whose task it is to regulate the use of skill and craft in the Realm. The only exit leads north through a high door. A notice on the granite wall reads "You may choose to be a wizard, a priest, or a ranger : speak your choice, or leave. Know that once made, your choice cannot be undone: and that your training will take up the rest of today, during which time you may not enter the Realm."                              This Guild was set up by Sunchild, an Immortal Assassin, who has been set among the Gods for his prowess at the Guild's deeds. The room is decorated with pictures of the great Realm killers - you recognise Axeman and Millicent - and examples of fine daggers and other weapons. In one corner stands the Guildmaster's throne: behind it is a picture of a halfling. Exits are through magical portals and lead to all areas of the Realm.                                                                                 This footpath travels down from the high western wooded glade and emerges into a small pathway which brightens as the forest becomes less dense and leads eastwards towards a small village. A tall thorn hedge runs parallel to the path on its northern side.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 You're on the crusty mud-caked road running from the village (which lies eastwards) towards a narrower western path. To the southwest the road joins a dirt track along which you notice the imprints of hooves and carriage wheels. In other directions the road is surrounded by a high thorn hedge (to the north) and a peculiar stationary mist.                                                                                                                                                                            This wide well-trodden road leads westwards, away from the village square not far to the east, into more open countryside along a wide dry roadway. To the north you see a timber structure from which you can smell a powerful odour of rawhide. The sides of wooden buildings block movement to the south.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    You stand in a spacious wooden enclosure which is well stocked with rolls of tanned leather, each of which is quite heavy and impossible to move single-handedly. A small window is visible at high level in the northern wall; the only door you can see is to the south.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      All around you there are products of the saddler's craft from the beautifully ornate riding seats to the harnesses which occupy most of the wall space. Most are far too bulky to be worth the taking. Behind a large heavy wooden counter you notice a door leading north, and to the south you may leave these premises.                                                                                                                                                                                                      As you enter this small ramshackle hut you are aware of a distinctly unpleasant smell. You guess that this is because of the dubious ingredients used in the adhesive with which the cobbler works. In any case, apart from a few rough sheets of leather thrown in the corner and some furnishings in the centre of the room, it is empty of items and the only exit is to the east.                                                                                                                                           You are travelling a straight road which leads south into the square of the village. As you look to the north, you see that progress that way is impossible -  a huge oak has fallen across the path. However a small hut stands to the west, its door invitingly open, and a glance in the opposite direction shows you a small path heading off behind the eastern buildings.                                                                                                                                                 This narrow yet well-worn pathway runs around the rear of a large timber framed building, from which you can detect the smell of hops and barley. You can go west onto the northern village road or follow the crescent-shaped pathway towards the south, where it meets with the road east of the square.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      You have entered the local village inn and immediately notice its sparse furnishings. However the sturdy looking timber stanchions and ceiling beams afford you a certain confidence in its structure. To the south you notice stairs leading to an upper floor; the large doors in the southwest corner open out to the village square. A cold draught blows through them, seemingly defeating the purpose of the roaring blaze in the large inglenook fireplace.                                                              As you enter this bedroom you stoop down somewhat to avoid hitting your head on the sloping rafters of the low roof. The window overlooks a narrow pathway but you find it too stiff to open. The furnishings are almost spartan, with a small cupboard standing against the wall and a dull mirror hanging over the minuscule bed. The only exit is the door to the south.                                                                                                                                                     This room appears fairly spacious - due to there being no furniture to speak of. It's obviously not been used in a long time, though the outline of a bed and table still remain on the dusty bare floorboards. Cobwebs hang from the closed window and you notice some thatch poking through the ceiling rafters where rainwater has penetrated. The only exit is the door to the south.                                                                                                                                       You are on the landing, at the top of a solid looking stairway (to the north) which leads down to the saloon and dining areas of the inn. To the northwest and northeast are two identical wooden doors leading to the bedchambers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             This is the centre of the village, with timber buildings and huts around its perimeter. It's a pleasant, stone-paved area, no more squalid than you'd expect, but the whole place has an air of complete desertion, as though it had recently been abandoned.  To the northeast lies the village inn, and the blacksmith's is southwest of the square. Main roads lead off towards the cardinal compass points and, as you look towards the southeast, you notice a familiar wooden structure...                                This road leads out from the village square (which lies to the west) and continues east. To the north a narrow path leads behind a large building, but there's no way of getting into the buildings on either side of the road from here. Further east you see a large gate which seems to block the road.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      You are on the western side of a tollgate which is situated at the end of a track running west into a village. To the east you can make out misty areas of open fields, but the gate is firmly barred and there's no way through. A notice on the gate reads "PAY TOLL", although you can't see anyone to pay it to.                                                                                                                                                                                                            You are in the southeastern part of the square, the stone paving of which has been slightly raised to a platform to accommodate the heavy timbered stocks which stand here. They are extremely sturdy and no doubt afford the villagers hours of harmless amusement - traces of indescribably rotten vegetation still remain. To the east you see an open doorway, through which a pleasant smell of dough emanates, and you can re-enter the main square in nearly all other directions.                                       This small yet comfortable building houses the village bakery where you can detect the odour of fresh baked bread and cakes. The hot ovens are solidly built of stone and the blackened marks above them are proof of the ferocity of the fires. A large door leads towards the west; opposite a smaller opening allows you into a cobbled yard.                                                                                                                                                                                A single room is all that comprises the abode of the herbalist and local healer. Above you on ramshackle shelving several bottles of all shapes and sizes teeter precariously and as you look around the sparse walls you notice the insecurity of the entire structure. Sudden movements might not be a good idea, except westwards onto the comparative safety of the main road...                                                                                                                                            Several large potholes are evident in this wide mud-caked roadway which runs in a north-south direction. Smaller paths lead off to the west and east, and a very dilapidated looking hut stands slightly to the northeast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Timber frames at various stages of completion meet your eye as you enter this large building and an assortment of planks and wooden offcuts litters the floor. Above you, higher than a human can reach, is an open trapdoor leading into what you guess is a loft, but you can see no obvious means of access to that area. There are no other directions of progression from here, other than south to the market place.                                                                                                      You have entered a small, open-ended enclosure which is fronted by two large posts upon which have been securely stapled a pair of very large and heavy horseshoes. The anvil stands in the centre of this area and behind it against the wall there is a large black stone furnace. Although no fire burns here, the furnace is still warm as though it had recently been used.                                                                                                                                                Traces of carriage wheels and horses' hooves remain in this large area where, on selected days of the week, village traders and visiting merchants gather together to sell their wares to an unsuspecting public. Running northwards is a small pathway leading to a large building outside which you can see some newly-built timber framing: eastwards is a wide north-south road.                                                                                                                                            This long wide road which runs from the village in the north heads out towards a horizon which is indistinctly shadowed by a grey mist. Upwards to the east, you see a narrow winding road flanked by wooden posts and to the southeast you can enter a grassy field through a break in the fencing. A small path leads southwest to a turnstile set in a high wooden fence.                                                                                                                                                    You are standing in the middle of a vast network of farmlands which stretch to the far distant north and east. Unfortunately, deep troughs and artificial canals separate them and they would constitute quite a hazardous crossing, quite apart from the danger of being caught trespassing... A five-bar gate allows you southwards back onto the roadway.                                                                                                                                                                    This pebbled pathway leads up to a large white stone-built farmhouse, which gives you the impression of a wealthy owner. The doors and windows are bolted shut and you cannot find any means of access into the building, so you can only return south onto the farm road - other directions are fenced off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    In between the high wooded post fencing which runs either side of this winding east-west road there are gated breaks - to both north and south - through which you can enter large open fields. The main village road is to the west and you can see a large stone building if you look to the northeast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       This little dirt road (heading east-west) has been trodden down by the movement of cattle and you pick your way carefully to avoid staining your footwear. The end of the cattle tracks is at the entrance to a large cowshed, to your south, and opposite there is a small gravel path which leads up and around the farmhouse. To the east the way's blocked by high fencing, and you can't even see what might lie beyond.                                                                                                   These flatlands have been seeded recently, as the new growth of stubbled grass shows. You realise how boring grass looks when situated in such a vast expanse. You could sit here and watch it grow if you like... however should you wish to leave you can walk through the gate northwards onto an east-west road, or climb through the fence to the northwest onto a north-south one.                                                                                                                                        This dark and dank building has been separated into smaller compartments each of which has been filled to half capacity with straw and hay. The odour which assails your nostrils is fine if you like that sort of thing... As you look for a means of exit you see only one door, leading north onto a dirt track.                                                                                                                                                                                                             You follow the lines of the carriage wheels interspersed with the imprint of various animals along this narrow track running north-south; down from the road (to the north) into a wide open flat area. To the west is the edge of a forest, but eastwards rolls a thick bank of white mist, looking strangely sinister.                                                                                                                                                                                                        Around the perimeter of this large open space are the remains of a camp of Travellers and further signs of temporary accommodation can be seen to the southwest and southeast. Various scattered ash-filled remains of camp fires have been left and a sizeable garbage tip has been deposited in the centre. A dirt track leads across open countryside to the northeast, but to the west and east the land drops away into treacherous gullies filled with swirling white mist - you would be unwise to go that way.          Broken pieces of furniture are scattered around, further evidence for the former use of this flat grassland as a nomad encampment. To the west and south the land falls away sharply into valleys, shrouded in thick white mist, of which you can see little: the steep drop prevents you from going in those directions. The camp continues north and east of you.                                                                                                                                                             This is the southeast corner of what looks like a former Gypsy camp, bounded here by steep cliffs to the south and east: you can make out few details of the land below, as it's veiled in dense mist, but away to the south there might be some kind of tower. The remains of several horse-drawn caravans lie here and as you look over the south cliff you see far below you mounds of dropped refuse into which you'd rather not fall. The open area continues to the north and west.                                       You stand in a dirty cobble-paved yard which runs around the east and south sides of an untidy-looking shack. To the north a stone wall blocks off the alleyway, but you can see a small opening in the wall of a building to the northwest. A broad road can be seen to the west.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              This wide open area, surrounded by trees, is the start of a hard earthen path, worn by the feet of many travellers as they venture from the dense woods to the west towards the small village which can be seen in the near eastern distance. The vegetation to the north is too thick for you to pass through, but off to the west you think you can see some kind of building. To the south the woods are misty and ill-defined.                                                                                              This is the carpenter's loft, where he keeps (or kept) all the work which was too valuable to be left unguarded in the workshop below. A large room with a thatched ceiling, it's now almost completely empty - it looks as if most of the large stuff has been taken away. The only exit is a drop through a trapdoor to the workshop.                                                                                                                                                                                         These are gloomy, dark woods, filled with wisps of swirling white mist which completely obscures the area to the south. North and east of here the trees seem clearer, and to the northeast you think you can make out some kind of clearing in the forest. Westwards however the trees are stunted and distorted and the mist gives them an evil aspect.                                                                                                                                                                       These misty woods seem to be the eastern extremity of the forest. Further east you can see a rough track of some kind, leading more or less north-south, while to the northeast you can vaguely see another path going east-west. Directly to the south the mist, which is all around you, becomes so thick that you cannot see what lies beyond it at all. The forest continues to the north and west, though to the north there seems to be some sort of clearing.                                                            You stand under a small garishly painted canopy east of a turnstile in a high wooden fence. Set in the turnstile is a slot, next to which is a picture of a hand holding a small circular object. There is an iron door in the southern wall of the turnstile, discoloured by ferocious heat - someone has tried to fireball it off its hinges. Mist surrounds the area to north and east, but a small path leads northeast through the mist, up to a wide road.                                                                You're wandering aimlessly among bright circus stalls set out in a large field: the small booth that you have stopped to examine is one of the few that are open. A water filled trough runs along the front of the stall, just beyond your reach: above it a sign urges you to "WIN THE GOLDEN DUCK". You can move through the fair to the south or northwest: east is the exit, a turnstile set in a high wooden fence.                                                                                                       You stand in a cramped office, with no windows. The only light comes from a door to the north. The floor is covered with ash and soot, obviously the remains of the furnishings, but what surprises you most is the armoured nature of the door and walls. You realise that this must be where all the takings from the turnstile are kept.                                                                                                                                                                                     You've come to a stall covered with mirrors which distort your face into peculiar shapes. You spend some time pulling faces to amuse yourself, until you come across one really revolting reflection, which causes you to pull up in shock. You quickly realise that this mirror is completely normal! You may pass northwards between the stalls.                                                                                                                                                                              You stand before a huge steel wheel like structure, which is slowly turning, although you cannot discern what powers it; wooden seats are fixed to it at regular intervals. The area to your southwest is occupied by an enormous striped tent, while high wooden fences to the north and south bar movement in that direction. You may go southeastwards among the fairground stalls, or pass under the tent's guy-ropes, to the west.                                                                                         Standing before the tent, you marvel at the size of it. Large from a distance, close up it is HUGE! Over the entrance to the south is a sign, rendered in bright pastel shades. It reads "Welcome to Nightspawn's Big Top O' Fun". Regarding the demoniacal features of the face underneath, you are not surprised that the area is deserted. Paths run eastwards toward the fairground, and westwards, following the high wooden fence to the north.                                                                           You are standing on a sawdust covered area, surrounded by tiers of seating. To your east and west tall posts tower above you, supporting the huge tent. Immediately above your head is a rope net strung between the posts. It has obviously been abused, with large holes torn in it, as if great weights have been dropped through it. Below the holes the sawdust is strangely discoloured. The tent is dimly lit, but there is a patch of brightness to the north, through the tent exit.                                   Standing at the eastern end of the circus ring, you gaze into the dimly lit heights of the tent. High above, you can discern a small stage. A rope ladder leads up the side of the tent post, into the gloom, and to the west the ring widens to its centre.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Taking a breather halfway up the eastern tent post you grab a chance to look round. Below you there is the circus ring, and above a small platform. You can also step onto a rope net, to your west, although it looks a little unsafe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         You are standing in the centre of a worn safety net, obviously used to catch anything falling from above. It is very worn, and sags alarmingly. It might be a good idea to return east to the tent post, quickly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The small platform on which you stand is fixed to the east tent post. It has safety rails on three sides, and a ladder leads down through a trap in the floor. The tent roof is not far above your head, and you can make out all sorts of ropes and pulleys, used in the performances. The circus ring is considerably further away. A feature not apparent from below is the rope which stretches away to a similar platform to the west.                                                                                     You've reached a small platform at the top of the west tent post, high above the floor of the Big Top. This is where the tightrope artists would rest before the hazardous journey back east, and so the rope is the only way of leaving this area.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             You're standing next to a tall post which towers upwards to the roof of the tent. Near the top you can see a small platform, but you cannot see any means of reaching it. To the east of you the ring widens, and further east you can see another post. There is a small flap in the tent to the west.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         You are in a dark covered area, an extension to the circus tent, which contains a number of large and strong cages. All are completely empty of life. The smell in this area is quite overpowering. You may enter the main tent to the east, or go out into the fresh air westwards. This covered area continues past the cages, to the south.                                                                                                                                                                                  You have entered a storage area, where the circus props are kept when not in use. Amongst the various smaller items there is a large glass sided tank filled with water, with steps running up one side. The picture on one side depicts a man upside down in it, with his hands and legs manacled. A revolting smell drifts from the north, and the only exit is in this direction.                                                                                                                                            Standing on top of the large tank, you can see the water through a trap door in the tank top. It looks deep, and very cold. You may go in, or climb down off the tank, using the steps behind you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              You are treading water in the top of a large tank. The water is freezing, and chills you to the bone. Above you is a trapdoor, and below you is, well more water really. The thick glass distorts the shapes of the items in the circus store, giving them peculiar appearances. If you can hold your breath for long enough, you may swim to the bottom of the tank.                                                                                                                                                           Taking small mouthfuls of air from the balloon, you manage to make it to the bottom of the tank. Your lungs feel as though they're bursting - you'd better head back to the surface soon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The camp fire in this clearing has been used recently - the ashes are still smouldering. This is where the circus retainers come after a hard day's performing, to have a barbecue and relax. You look at the unidentifiable lumps of meat in the fire, and wonder about the empty animal cages nearby. A path leaves northwards, bending round the huge tent which you may enter to the east. The clearing is surrounded by caravans: those to the south, west and northwest are open.                                         Entering the small caravan, you are confronted by a shelf of grinning masks. Below this is a mirror, and there are greasepaints and red noses on the table. The door's to the north.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            This is a roughly built, sparsely furnished caravan. At one end there's a board with a man-shaped drawing on it, covered in knife marks. Red-brown patches surround those knife marks within the shape. Eastwards you can enter a grassy clearing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              This caravan is covered with arcane symbols, with silver stars and crescents much in evidence. In fact, it looks to you like the sort of place which would be used by a charlatan for parlour tricks, rather than a real practitioner of the arts. The door faces southeast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    You are standing in the northwestern corner of the circus area. To your north and west further movement is blocked by the high encircling fence of wooden stakes that forms the circus boundary: close by to the southeast is the main tent of the circus, though you cannot enter it from here. Paths lead off to the east and south.                                                                                                                                                                                          You are in a large dimly lit room of which the main feature is a portrait of The Joker himself - he is grinning widely. The other walls are covered in bookcases. In one corner is a desk, littered with empty vials labelled "Nitrous Oxide - Industrial Strength". The strangest thing in here, however, cannot be seen. All you can hear are distant howls of maddening laughter - the sounds of the undead spirits The Joker has dispatched to another dimension. You feel yourself begin to giggle awkwardly...
