tree
5
The tree is a majestic and ancient chestnut, about 100 feet tall and perhaps 
20 in circumference. Runes are carved in the bark, but you can make nothing 
of them. The tree's climbable.

The baleful oak is just a shell of what must once have been a great tree. 
Presumably it's been poisoned by the salt water; it's almost dead, and the 
wood wouldn't bear your weight if you tried to climb it.

The strange tree is like nothing you've ever seen before. Its trunk is 
smooth and a peculiar grey colour and its branches a mass of tentacles. 
You could climb it if you liked, but it might not be a good idea...

The rickety bridge was built by kobolds to span a gap in the floor of the 
caverns where one passage collapsed into another. It's not very strong.

The great stone bridge is the work of the men who inhabited the City. It 
was built thousands of years ago but has stood the test of time fairly well.

The cairn's just a rough heap of irregular stones. It was here for a reason, 
but it has stood unused for so long that even the Gods have forgotten it...

The lever is a length of rusty iron protruding at an angle from the wall. 
It would probably be possible to move it, if you pulled.

portcullis
1
The portcullis is a strong grid, made of crossed bars of iron, which can 
be raised and lowered through a hole in the roof. There doesn't seem to be 
any way of moving it from here, though, so the controls must be elsewhere.

hatch

The hatch is of strong metal and is set firmly in the floor. There's no

throne

This is the throne of Nanjusi, god of death and destruction and nasty 
things like that. It's where he sits when his ego wants boosting. Hehe.
@

The throne is large and heavy, made from a block of stone and carved with 
the standard strange runes and symbols. It's where the Kings of the Realm 
used to sit to be crowned (and on various other occasions.)
@

The throne was made of wood and then gilded, but the gold leaf has long 
since been stripped away by greedy adventurers and the wood is battered and 
hacked by the axes of looters.
@

The throne seems to be red, and is vaguely throbbing. The Freudian 
significance of this is not difficult to deduce.
@

775
The throne is intricately carved wood and is much too heavy to take away 
(don't say the thought hadn't entered your head!) It belongs to the 
Master of the Guild of Assassins.
